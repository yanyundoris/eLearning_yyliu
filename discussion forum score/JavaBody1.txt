To describe an action to be the best is very vague. Based on different conditions like safety or energy consumption, the methods that are taken would be different.

There are some issues need to be verified and satisfied. Well as we can see, the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London is through air travel, planes but, the question here is are capable of doing it? First thing we need to confirm is the CAPABILITY of that person to travel. Under that, it will be the Individual's aspect- this includes physical or psychological issues. Next thing to do is the MODE OF TRANSPORTATION- there are lots of ways one can use to transport them from one place to another. It will be followed-up by this question, are convenient with that? then do you have the capacity to pay. Lastly, what will be the probable effect after. Remember, all of us wants a happy endings :)

Also the statement is not terminated by semicolon ';'.\n\nLine #10 :  Celsius should be replaced by celsius and 9/5 should be written as 9.0/5 or 9/5.0 or 9.0/5.0.

"Finding the Best way to travel to London" is rather a vague description of what we are supposed to do. Since the phrase doesn't cover what he means by "best". Best for some can mean cheapest, fastest, safest, most realible or easiest. Thus the word "Best" becomes relative to what someone thinks its best in their patterno of thinking. Plus he doesnt explain if we are allowed to use transportation or if we are supposed to try to reach hong kong by walking and swimming. Also when considering the best way to travel do are we supposed to worry about unexpected issues during our trip such as bad weather, accidents, traffic jams, flight cancellations etc?\n As you can see there are several different interpretations and solutions for this matter.

If I had to venture a guess. I would say that it is not a well defined problem. The issue is in the fact that the "best way" can be viewed multiple ways. As someone pointed out earlier, the best way to a businessman and to a tourist are two different things. A tourist may want to make small detours to take in sites, while a businessman will want to take the shortest route possible to maximize time and efficiency.

Abstraction is the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. for example when you consider the case of e-mail, complex details such as what happens soon you send an e-mail, the protocol your email server uses are hidden from the user, therefore to send an e-mail you just need to type the content, mention the address of the receiver and click send.\n\nlike wise in Object oriented programming Abstraction is a process process of hiding the implementation details from the user, only the functionality will be provided to the user.

As explained before, well defined problem means there would be a solution for it, and travelling from Hong Kong to London provides many solutions. But the question is the best way to travel. It is clear that the person who is asking the question wants the best way to get there. But as I read in the earlier responses, which London exactly? There can be a number of places with same name. If you could provide with more details about the places, it would be more easier to find a solution for the question raised. Finally, I say it's a well defined problem, as there is a solution for it.

Hi LeoKosch99\n\nthis "graded task" is about checking your method's implementation.\n\nThis method must be called to draw any image, by giving some parameters ( 4 ) : a canvas, two coordinates ( "x" and "y" positions) and an angle ( to rotate the image ).\n\n    \n\n> public void draw(Canvas canvas, int x, int y, int rotation) {...}\n\n\nso, the grader online is testing your code to know if is working in several situations... by passing different arguments...\n\nfor example ( according with your error messages )\n\n>     Case 1 : "rock" with x = 0, y = 0, rotation = 0\n>     Case 2 : "paper" with x = 12, y = 24, rotation = 180\n>     Case 3 : "scissors" with x = -39, y = -42, rotation = 360\n\nthe error seems to be that **you always set up the position "x = 0" and "y = 480" in any case, and you do not care about the arguments passed in the method**:\n\n> public void draw(Canvas canvas, **int x**, **int y**, int rotation) {...}\n\n\n*note:* as result of the implementation of this method, it can be invoked to draw the computer's image and the player's image...:)\n\n\nlet us know if you could get it

Line 17 is declare wrong since it is an construct\n\nLine 22 should return a string instead of doing a print statement since it function return type is string\n\nLine 29 parameter  should be declare as a string since variable id is of type of string\n\nLine 33 function return parameter should be a string since it return a string\n\nLine 42 is calling the constructer, but needs a string value to be pass

Hi, Im Fernando from Peru. I started Computer Sciences 21 years ago in my university but I struggled a lot with Analytical Calculus (i failed AC1 2 times with AC 2 and AC 3 ahead) and I didn't touched a computer in 2 years so I got bored, thought about studying a technical career but I didn't have much support at home (going to college (5 years career) is VERY important in my country, so saying that I was thinking about going to an institute was not an option.\nI studied Laws, so Id have the money to pay for my "computer hobbies". \nNow I dont have the time, or the money to study the 3 years institute career (which depending what you choose is mostly Java programming or CCNA Routers&Switches Certification. \nSo I started studying Java by myself, planning to avoid paying for a Java Fundamentals course but now Im thinking that maybe I'll skip the java web developer and java advanced developer, depending on how I handle it. Its just my first month in this. Maybe in 1 year I'll try the Oracle Certified Associate,  and the Certified Professional 1 year later.\nNext week I'll start a 1 year CCNA R&S training course in the institute I  wanted to study years ago.\nIve just finished this Introduction to Java programming 1 with 85% (yay?) so hope to see you in Java Intro to Programming 2.\nGood luck!

- The constructor Ironman is badly defined. A constructor doesn't need any type (void, int,...) on its declaration.\n- The methods cleanSlateProtocol and setID are wrong too, because they need specify a type in their declaration (void, int,...)\n- The method getName has a wrong type in its declaration. It is returning nothing, because it is declared as void. Then, always we call it, never we will get the value we want.
559a3085b30d8463fc0011d9
I can figure out the output by hand. However, the chances of me getting it right, are slim.\n\nRe-using identifiers in different scopes do make sense when the identifiers carry semantic meaning, like `amount` in the banking example. But in this case, the `a`,`b`, and `c` are meaningless to me, and the program would of course have been more readable  if the eight variables (two global, two in the class, and two in each method) had different names.

It is likely that you are not aware of that the program is running when the program is actually running. To tell whether the program is running, you can observer the "barber pole" just above the lower left hand corner of BlueJ. if it is animating, the problem is running and we cannot perform any compilation. In order to stop a running program, we right-click the barber pole and click **"Reset Java Virtual Machine"**. That will stop the program and allows compilation.\n\nAs a further note, we often not realize the program is running because the Terminal windows is not showing  up. One can bring up the terminal windows by clicking on the **"View" -> "Show Terminal"** in the BlueJ IDE. :)

Sorry again...\n\nThis is a question for task 3. I loaded the images in the correct sequence but it says they are not in the right position?

I apologise once again. What i was writing up there was not appearing fully, it might be network failure care. My note for the above pictures description was that i successfully downloaded the javac version to the needed one. As shown above, but after loading my program in the bluej, thats after succesfully compiling it without a single error. But while trying to run the main method i got the above  error described in the last image which was my first issue before even coming to all these steps.Hpe you can help me fix it soon. The course is almost done. I am now trying to do everything to finish even this part one before its time is over. Thank you for every single help ^_^

hi **gabby_agedah**,\n\nCurrently, you are placing the second and the third image in the same position. One thing that you can do is to output the x positions of the images that you are now setting to (i.e. c1.getWidth() + 10 and c2.getWidth() + 10). Then from the output values, you should be able to tell why the result doesn't come out as expected. :)

Thanks leofan for your extensive reply! It was exactly the type of information I needed.  I am almost done with part 1 (in terms of passing grade) so I think this can work out, but like you say, I should expect part 2 to require significantly more time.\n\nI am now positive about passing the courses, but I will probably have to skip much material not directly needed to complete the tasks. I am hoping I can revisit this after the deadline, so:\n\n *Will the material be accessible for 3-4 weeks after the deadline so I can make sure I do not miss out on the full learning experience?* \n\nThanks again!

The re-run dates are still to be confirmed but will be announced once it is finalized. :)
571606621dfe59051d00026d
hi **octado**,\n\nI would like to tell you the exact date for the re-runs, but we will need to confirm with edX staff before we can give out an definite answer. Once we have confirmed, we will send out mass emails to all of the learners. \n\nFor the possibility of finishing both the courses before the deadline **Apr 26 23:30 (GMT +8)**, I would say it depends mostly on part 2 of the course. Since you have a background on C/C++, part 1 should be quite straight forward. The main concepts in part 1 that might be new to you are "classes and objects", "character strings" and some coding syntax. Part 2, on the other hand, will introduce some OOP concepts in Java, event-driven programming and abstract data types which would require more time to master. The lab exercises in part 2 will also require more effort for completing.\n\nAs a suggestion, I think you could try and see if you could complete part 1 in a short time and then have a quick glance at part 2 materials to see if you are confident to finish them in the remaining time. Given your background, I think you should be able to obtain a verified certificate in part 1 before the deadline. :)\n\n

hi **Giannisjome**,\n\nHere is a few tips:\n\n1. Scanner is a class defined in java.util package. To use it in the grader, you will need to specify the full qualified name, details [**here**][1].\n\n2. Java is a case sensitive language, so **`System`** which starts with a capital **'S'** is different from **`system`** which starts with a small letter **'s'**.\n\n3. To concatenate two character strings together, we should use the "+" (addition) operator instead of the "," (comma) operator. For example, if we wish to print out the words "hello" and "world" so that it becomes a phrase "hello world", we would code:\n\n> ...out.println("hello" + "world");\n\nThere are some other potential problems, but if you test it in BlueJ before submitting to the grader, it should be easy to find out. Here is a sample output for the exercise:\n\n ![Lab 02 Graded Task 2 Sample Output][2]\n\nLet us know if you have further problems. :)\n\n<!--\nScanner\nSystem vs system\nOutput format\nVariable redefinition\nprint VS println\ninteger division\ndata types\nstring concatenation\n-->\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/56173a0e9714b05d1700321b\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/lab_02_graded_task_2_sample.png

hi **LeoKosch99**,\n\nThere are still some time remaining and it is still possible for you to complete the entire course with a passing grade given that you have completed week 2 in just a day. However, in case you couldn't make it before the deadline, you may try to contact edX staff for a possible refund and enroll into our course again once it is re-run in the near future. You may contact edX staff by using the **Help** button on the left of this page. :)

hi **ck_wije**,\n\nEncapsulation allows raw data to be hidden from other parties and can only be accessed and modified through trusted means. Encapsulation is important in developing large software in a distributed manner to avoid unwanted behavior. One of the common ways to achieve encapsulation in Java is to declare our instance variables to be **`private`** and provide properly written **`public`** methods to access or modify these variables.\n\n:)

hi grzechotnik\n\n1) create and initialize a variable to be returned with the "final result".\n\n2) as instructions say, if the power of the number is negative then return "1"\n\n3) otherwise you have to create a loop ( a for or while loop can be used )\nif you want to use a while loop then use a condition to run the loop than the power of the number is more than "0" (e.g.).\n\nincrease the initial value of the variable defined at the beginning by **multiplying by the same number** and **decrease the power of the number by one**, once you while loop is going to executed again until the power of number becomes to "zero", when that occurs then return the "final result".\n\n\ntry your code first in BlueJ before submitting your code

When the program starts, though the initial value assigned to a and c are 2 and 1 respectively. In main method after an instance of class Scope1 s is created, the values assigned to a and b are 4 and 5 respectively. When the method two is invoked in main with the parameters a and b (values 4 and 5), method two invokes method one with values 5 and 4. Method one is executed first with a=5 and b = 5. After calculation for a, b and c, the values become a = 7, b = 5 and c = 10 which are printed first. This method returns value b=5 to method two which is assigned to c in that method. In method b, a will have value 4 initially, but after calculation, the value again remains 4 as calculation is done for global variable (i.e. this.a). Values printed are a = 4, b = 5 and c = 5. Method two will return the value of a = 4 to main method which is assigned to variable b. While printing, a accessed is global variable a, i.e. 5, b = 4 and c = 5.

It looks like that Apple is deprecating some of its audio features on OSX while Java is still assuming that these features are available. Nevertheless, those are just warning messages and should not affect the running of the football program. You should still see the ball moving with animation after you finish the implementation of the two methods in the Shooter class. :)

Sorry for asking so many times but there is still too many dots in that line:\nint gameResult = player.getChoice().compareWith(computer.getChoice());\nAs you pointed out in player.getChoice() the dot is between objectReference and methodName.\nIn computer.getChoice the dot is also between objectReference and methodName.\nBut there is also a dot between getChoice() and compareWith() and compareWith() is not a method in   getChoice() which is not even an object but a method. So what is the function of that dot?\nWhat I understand compareWith method should be called as Choice.compareWith(some parameter). Or is player.getChoice.compareWith() the same as Choice.compareWith() because player.getChoice returns a choice variable?

There is a void in parameterized constructor which should not be there. A new non parameterized constructor is needed for creation of first object. dance() method don't need any return type so make it void. void return type should be given to the method cleanSlateProtocol(). getName() method should be assigned void return type as it don't return anything. parameter sent to setID() method should be of type String.

Thanks for the long explanation. There must something more  basic I don't understand in the line:\n\n> int gameResult = player.getChoice().compareWith(computer.getChoice());\n\n**`player.getChoice()`** is calling a method getChoice in **Player.class** and returns let's say 0(rock).\n\n**`computer.getChoice()`** is calling a method getChoice in **Computer.class** and returns let's say 1(paper).\n\nSo the line can be written 0.compareWith(1)\n\nWhat is the function of the dot between 0  and compareWith(1)?\n\nDoes that set type variable in Choice class to 0?\n\n\n

hi FernandoGV\n\n\n\n...after your implementation of "compareWith()" method in the "Choice.class" with your code, you can test its result by using the class provided in the project called "**Lab04GradedTask1.class**" and run "**testCase1()**" method, also you could add more test cases to validate your implementation and know if works correctly.\n\n\n*In fact, anything designed with a "switch" statement can be done with "if-else" statements.*\n\n\nHope was helpful\n\n\n

I too wanted to redo a version of a barcode generator as was shown in the video example. I kept running into a compiling error but have since fixed it. Here is the code I used:\n\n>     import comp102x.IO;\n>     \n>     /**\n>      * This program demonstrate simple arithematics values represented by barcodes\n>      */\n>     public class BarcodeDemo\n>     {\n>        public static void main(String[] args) {\n>            // Output the values represented by the two barcodes\n>            \n>            long value1;\n>            \n>            IO.output("Barcode value: ");\n>            value1 = IO.inputLong( );\n>            \n>            // Output the calculation results as images on the file system\n>            IO.outputBarcode(value1);\n>        }\n>     }\n\n\nMy compiing error was coming from trying to assign value1 a value I did not realize that the line IO.inputLong had a lowercase L for long. It works great after I fixed the error.

hi **jhasubhadra**,\n\nTwo main things here. Firstly, all the output messages must follow the specified format, this includes the wording and the spaces. Secondly, the online grader does not import the Scanner class by default. If you wish to use the Scanner class, you will have to specify it in the full qualifying name, i.e. **java.util.Scanner**\n\nP.S. You may want to test the program in BlueJ first to make sure the output is something like the following:\n\n![Lab 02 Graded Task 1 Sample output][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/lab_02_graded_task_1_sample.png

A keyboard is an example of abstraction. The keys mask the software and hardware within the computer that enable the user to use to computer effectively.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I disagree because easiest way could imply least time, least distance, or least cost.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I agree with you
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
The problem is not well defined because it doesn't define the best way of travel. The best way could mean least time, least distance, least cost, and quality of transportation. Specifying this will make the problem a well defined problem.

If I understand this correctly if the equation read 2.0 + 15.0 / 6.0 * 4.0 then the answer of 12.0 would be the result? When JAVA looks at the numbers 15 and 6 they are integers by default and when divided the answer is converted to an integer? so in order to get a double by default from an equation each number would have to be written in double format?

But the "Apply Botton" there was unclickable  after i pressed the "Ok botton" in almost two different pages after applying the System variable as shown above.\nAfter making all the above changes in the command prompt, my javac version reply's path cannot be located once more again :(\n"'Javac' is not recognised as an internal or external comand, operable program or batch file ."\nI went back to the System variable to create new and i replaced the past one as it was but i cant locate the javac version again.\nAnyway, whats the next step please?\nHope i can get out of this trap soon.\nThank you\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14602837629267137.jpg\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14602841309719401.jpg

As a sailor, i come across abstraction on a daily basis as regards the equipment i use on board my ship. for example, The radar system, the DCS, the Fire Panel, and the Auto steering system all are located on the bridge. The sailor does not care how the radar functionality hapens all he cares is that when he acquires a target using the mouse and click on the radar, it displays the other ships activities. same goes with the DCS, he click at the emergency fire pump icon and clicks on start button then the fire pump starts running immediately. The Fire Control panel indicates where a fire is by activating a fire alarm and the sailor only need to press a button to silence it, he does not care how the mechanism works. The steering system is a very complex mechanism but the sailor only need to turn a button on the bridge to change over from manual to Auto or from Auto to manual.

Yes. If you can do java part 2 and android later and still complete the XSeries without re-taking part 1. However, You must obtain verified certificates in all of the three courses in order to complete the XSeries. :)

hi **cont-sebi**,\n\nThat's a very nice try! One can also consider calculating the unit distance in the X and Y directions by dividing the distances in each direction by numberOfTimes. We may then update both X and Y in a single iteration of the loop for moving the Car in both directions simultaneously. :)

This is the first code:\n\n    if (distX >=0){\n            for (int i = 1; i <= distX; i++){\n                carImage.setX(carImage.getX() + 1);\n                pause (timpu);\n            }\n        }else {\n            for (int i = -1; i >= distX; i--){\n                carImage.setX(carImage.getX() - 1);\n                pause (timpu);\n            }\n        }\n\n    if (distY >=0){\n            for (int i = 1; i <= distY; i++){\n                carImage.setY(carImage.getY() + 1);\n                pause (timpu);\n            }\n        }else {\n            for (int i = -1; i >= distY; i--){\n                carImage.setY(carImage.getY() - 1);\n                pause (timpu);\n            }\n        }\n\nAnd if you put an inclination of ten degrees go first in the x direction after that in the y direction not straight ahead to the point. This means in x and y direction simultaneously. So I think this would be the solution to move sequentially in the direction of x and y a number of times. So that's the second code:\n\n    for(int unu = 1; unu<= numberOfTimes; unu++){\n            if (distX >=0){\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence1; i++){\n                    carImage.setX(carImage.getX() + 1);\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }else {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence1; i++){\n                    carImage.setX(carImage.getX() - 1);\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }\n\n        if (distY >=0){\n                for (int i = 1; i <=  distSequence2; i++){\n                    carImage.setY(carImage.getY() + 1);\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }else {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence2; i++){\n                    carImage.setY(carImage.getY() - 1);\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }   \n        }

I am very sure this program will run into syntax error because constructor parameters don't agree with declaration and that's mismatch.

hi\n\nAs is explained in the course, it provides a special library designed\nto facilitate the use of some classes defined in java\nand make an use of them easier.\n\nThis library named "comp102x" contains several .jar files and each of these\nhas several files inside with ".class" extension, these ".class" files are already compiled so you are unable to open them to check their code.\n\n\nthat means importing the library in your project allows you to use these classes already compiled like IO.class\n\nTo see where that class is stored into the comp102x library, see images below :\n[ but remember that you cannot open it]\n\n\n\n    \n\n> **lib+ > comp102x_lib v2.1x.jar > IO.class**\n\n**comp102x_lib v2.1x.jar**\n\n![comp102x_lib v2.1x.jar][1]\n\n**IO.class**\n\n![comp102x_lib v2.1x.jar][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14596264403547522.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14596264643824555.png

Hi, \n\nI have read the previous posts about the reasons for 3.0 vs. 6.4, however, I do have a question as to why if I enter the calculation into BlueJ - I get the output of 6.4.  Would you be able to help me understand why this is?  Shouldn't this work the same way in order to get the answer of 3.0?\n\n![BlueJCalc][1]\n\nThanks for your help,\nJennifer\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1459538714457545.png

Like a Landphone set. You can press the buttons as you like to make a call but you don't need to manually set the line to telephone company. You even don't know how the calls are going to destination. The programmer will just design which button actually work to make the desired call you want. the other technical team will do their part.

Hi,\n\nSimply speaking, I believe we need four main things to display runic characters:\n\n1. Whether a suitable encoding is used to **save** the source file\n2. Whether a suitable encoding is used to **compile** the source code\n3. Whether a suitable encoding is used to **execute** the program\n4. Whether a font for **displaying** the runic characters is available\n\n[**UTF-8**][1] is character encoding scheme the could encode all characters and in the following explanation, we will mainly focus on UTF-8.\n\n___\n\nAssume we have a source file Runes.java saved in UTF-8 encoding. In Windows, in the Command Line Console (cmd.exe), we can compile the program with a specified an encoding like the following:\n\n>     javac -encoding utf-8 Runes.java\n\nThen, we can run the program with a specified encoding like the following:\n\n>     java -Dfile.encoding=utf-8 Runes\n\nHowever, the font for displaying the Runic characters is **not available for cmd** and as a result, we cannot display the runic characters in cmd. **(Note that a Runic font should exist on Windows systems as we can display the Runic characters in notepad)**\n\n___\nBlueJ saves the source code and compiles the program in UTF-8 encoding. However, I could not tell whether BlueJ is running the program by using UTF-8 or not. So it could be the encoding problem or the font problem or both for BlueJ.\n\n___\nInterestingly, in eclipse, I obtained the following result:\n\n![Displaying Runic Characters in Eclipse][2]\n\nDepending on the default encoding used in the Operating System, you might receive an error message like the following when saving the course code before compiling and running the program:\n\n![Eclipse saving file in utf-8 encoding][3]\n\nMy best guess is that after I click on **"Save as UTF-8"**, eclipse automatically configure the project so that utf-8 is used for both compiling and running the program. And since eclipse is able to use the Runic fonts in the operating system, the runic characters are displayed.\n___\n\nThe information here might not be fully accurate, but it should shed some light on the problem. One further problem to consider could be how to deploy a program with the ability to display runic fonts on an arbitrary computer. I will leave this for interested learns to dig out themselves. :)\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1459481549885670.png\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14594821402567745.png

And when I made check with "public class Lab04GradedTask1" went well. But I do not know if I answered correctly because I can not check because I have used 5 of 5 submissions.\n\nAnd another thing I do not understand why should I write anotherChoice.getType and not anotherChoice.gettype? Why gives me error when I write anotherChoice.gettype because instance variable type it's in lowercase?\n\n\n----------\n\n\n*Edited by TAC, please observe the Honor Code ( do not post full code on board)*

hi **GregLesnie**,\n\nThe first statement should produce no compilation error as the expression indeed returns a double value which is then assigned to a double variable. A double value is also returned in the second expression, this time however, a compilation error occurs as we are assigning the double value to a float variable, which is not large enough to hold a double value. This explains the loss of precision error.\n\nNote that when we write the decimal number **4.0** in Java, it is recognized as a **double literal** but not a **float literal**. If we want to specify a float literal, we have to add the suffix **f** after the decimal number, e.g. **4.0f**. \n\n[**Here**][1] is an interesting discussion where you can find more information. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/56b9556317a62f05130006b4

The string handling in Java is OK, I think. Because when I copy the rectangles and paste them into Notepad, they are shown as runes. My problem seems to be that the font used by Java console and BlueJ does not cover the entire Unicode character set. \n\n(No problem with bits and bytes, the problem is with the graphical representation of the characters.)

hi MP753\n\nthe class called "Week3Quiz" contains :\n\n**1)** an **instance variable "x"** declared as private, so only can be invoked by methods inside the class. ( "x" cannot be called by an external class) and also this class does not provided a public method that could return its value or set another value.\n\n**2)** By the other hand, the class "Week3Quiz" provides **two constructors** with different arguments to be passed.\n\n**3)** Finally there is a method **"main" inside the class** that is creating two "Week3Quiz.class"'s objects acording with the parameters passed : "q1" and "q2" that will update the instance variable "x".\n\nAfter that, two statements will print on terminal the instance variables associated to both objects directly invoking : **"q1.x" and "q2.x". IMPORTANT: This can be done because the "main" method is defined inside that class.**\n\n\n\nYou could try to run this code ( two classes ) to know what happens:\n\n\n----------\n\n\n   \n>     public class Week3Quiz {\n\n>         private double x;      \n>         public Week3Quiz(int i, double d) {\n>             x = i + d;\n>         }        \n>         public Week3Quiz(double d, int i) {\n>             x = i - d;\n>         }     \n>     }\n>        \n\n\n----------\n\n\n>     import comp102x.IO;\n>     public class Week3QuizDemo {\n>         public static void main(String[] args) {\n>        \n>             Week3Quiz q1 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10);\n>             Week3Quiz q2 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10.0);\n>            \n>             IO.outputln(q1.x); // statement 1\n>             IO.outputln(q2.x); // statement 2\n>         }\n>     }

In traveling from Hong Kong to London, it is not well defined problem as there are several locations named "London" (London Canada, London Kentucky, London Ohio, etc.), which London is the destination? Let just say London has been clearly defined as to which one is our destination, but where exactly in London is the destination, is it a specific street, a particular building? Is there a time frame? Is there any limitations/constraints on the method used to travel? As you can see there are several questions that need to be asked in order to complete the objective, therefore this is not a well-defined problem.

Hi SheetalRK\n\nwithout seeing your math expressions, i cannot tell you where is the mistake.\n\nBut do not worry, this lab is not really difficult.Some hints:\n\n**1)** revise all parenthesis and its scopes, maybe you have to add some extra ones.\n\n**2)** to make easy your expressions, you can split them into smallest ones. E.g. :\n\n>     double root = Math.sqrt( ...  (...))\n>     \n>     double sol =  ((...  root)...(...)) )\n\n\nhope was helpful

Google Drive is another example of abstraction in our daily use as the cloud storage. We are not concerned about how it is available to us all the time, what we know is, we have a reserved space over the cloud with functions like upload, download, modify and properties like name, size, hierarchy of our stored data in specified manner.

Many of the things that we use everyday - which others have already written about !   The microwave is a perfect example of something that is commonly used by many people.  
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The following code would give us an error because they are different variables , what we should do is convert the variables which will be used
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
An error or exception would be thrown
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
There are a lot of daily life examples which describe abstraction.Some of them are given below.\nRoad signs &signals,Models,Maps,Control Panel of elevator or other electrical or electronic devices,Gearing or racing system of car driving or bike riding,Remote of electronic devices such as TV, VCD ,DVD,Remote control car.electronic devices in which embedded software is written such as microwave oven.Applications in your mobile phone etc,are some common examples of abstraction from our daily life.We use above mentioned things but don't think that how they work.

No,It isn't a well defined problem because in it we don't know for which purpose you want to travel from Hong Kong to London.Either for business deal or travelling point of view so you should clear your purpose.On the behalf of your purpose planner design the plan that what is the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London for you.

Hi Pato, I came to the forums looking to understand the same thing Kiminmiami was talking about and I honestly can't follow your explanation (sorry...) because I suspect it requires some basic understanding of arrays and rules relating to arrays.\n\nIs there anyway you might be able to dumb down the above explanation to someone who studied only at a discrete math level decades ago? \n\nThanks alot!\n\nBen\n\n

1.In our daily life we need to travel to many different places , the main concept is to travel and reach our destination in the duration of time, How we travel or what we choose to travel is not considered, and thus is the another example of abstraction.\n2. At the time of examination it is just important to write the exam and score marks, the important thing here is writing exam,  by using which pen , or how that pen is made or from where we got the paper is not considered , i guess it is also a type of abstraction.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
i agree that it is not a well defined problem as many important constraints are missed here  like exact place name, Modes of transport, cost, time .
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
I could say about the way we learn things while we're reading a text. We know that "something" happens between our phisical ability for skimming the text with the eyes and the brain's ability of making us undertand the information. 
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Well , like many other colleagues have said , I would say that this is not a well-defined problem. A well-defined problem requires a set of its possible answers , defined in terms of the variables involved in the matter . In this case , the variables are not given , so the problem becomes too large to be solved .Whats means "best way"? For who?, "When?" We can'ts see where the problem starts and its expected solutions. Searching a very  synthetic response, in Wikipedia is given the following about the matter:\n\n> *Ill-defined problems* are those that **do not have** clear goals, solution\n> paths, or expected solution. Well-defined problems have specific\n> goals, clearly defined solution paths, and clear expected solutions.\n> These problems also allow for more initial planning than ill-defined\n> problems.Being able to solve problems sometimes involves dealing\n> with pragmatics (logic) and semantics (interpretation of the problem).\n> The ability to **understand what the goal of the problem is** **and what\n> rules could be applied represent the key to solving the problem**.\n> Sometimes the problem requires some abstract thinking and coming up\n> with a creative solution.

Hey my name is Anubrata , I'm from India and I'm an undergraduate student (B.tech in Computer Science) , with a little bit of knowledge about JAVA , C and C++ . I love to code and thus always try to find new stuff to learn .  It looks like i was a bit late in registering to the course , but i still hope that i can learn a lot and complete the course in time. :)

The compiler returns: "no suitable constructor found for Week3Quiz(double,double)", which is understandable as there is no such constructor with matching arguments... After 'fixing' q3, q4 will return a compiler error: "reference to Week3Quiz is ambiguous", which again illustrates argument mismatch... This time, the 'int vs. double'  concepts actually states that the statement can be done in more than one way.

Exactly true and funny too. 
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
How about a computer? Take for instance a keyboard itself. Users do not mind about how the data keyed into the system is processed but rather the keys on the keyboard function as designed. So a keyboard will work the same even in the event of a major change in a software program like Microsoft Word.

Just to agree with everyone else that the problem is not well defined and, therefore, raises a lot of questions about how that problem ought to be tackled. Already, everyone has their different opinions about how to solve this problem. The problem is short of giving specifics, like, what constitutes the "best way"? What factors have to be considered in order to arrive at the solution? Some could consider the best way in terms of how fast one travels between the two cities, ie. Hongkong and London  while yet others might look at the cheapest means to travel between the two places and many more. There are a lot of factors that need to define the phrase "the best way" in order to consider this a well-defined problem.

The answer of finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London will vary person to person. One can choose direct flight from Hong Cong to London if it suits him or her or else if has some business in Delhi then best way for him will be Hong Cong to Delhi and then Delhi to Hong Cong rather Hong Cong to London and then London to Delhi.\nThus problem is not well defined.

This should be caused by the different decimal separator used in our countries. Please refer to [**this post**][1] and search for **"decimal separator"** for the details. Or in short, you can try to replace the period **(.)** with a comma **(,)** and see if it works. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/559e11fab30d843e96001375

Hi **SameerDudeja**,\n\nYou will only need to submit the three lines for outputting within the curly braces of the main method. That is, given the following as the entire code:\n\n>     public class Lab01\n>     {\n>             public static void main(String[] args)  {\n>         \n>                     // Please write your code after this line\n>                     (line 1)\n>                     (line 2)\n>                     (line 3)\n>             }\n>     }\n\nWe will follow a similar approach in the rest of the coding exercise in this course. Please remove the unnecessary parts and submit again. :)

When i right click on the package as you described above, the options i only see are; open, copy, cut delete and properties without open with. Also, if i get back to open it as whole folder. Thats before opening the zipped folder i do see the open "Open with". And when i open it with Bluej from there i get this error :" The output directory for the archieve being extracted already exists.

Hello,\nMy name is Muhammad Bashir Muhammad. A graduate student from Statistics department of Kano University of Science and Technology, Wudil, Kano State at of December 2015. I have little knowledge on Java ,C C++ and C#. Trying to know more as i only know very little from the above languages as i have learned little of Java at our university and of the others i learned little from a diploma in web development which i just graduated from.\nI am happy to join you guys all here and thanking the school with the teacher that offer this course, with edx which make it easy for us. Thank you all ^_^

Hi **DRaffe**,\n\n![Explanation of errors in Module 05 Graded Problem Task 7][1]\n\nJava considers the variable array as redefined because the parameters of the methods are treated the same as local variables of the method. Therefore, the code is actually translated into:\n\n>     public static int q2()\n>     {\n>         int[] array = ...; // whatever integer array you passed to the method\n>         int[] array = {7, 25, 12, 10, 12};\n>     \n>         ... // the rest of the code\n>     }\n\nwhere we can clearly see a redefinition.\n\nAlso, the **`println`** statement cannot be placed after the return statement. This is because once Java finished executing the return statement, it will redirect the execution flow to the caller of this method. Any statement put after the return statement will not be executed and will cause a compilation error.\n\nAs a piece of small advice, you should try to find out the answer without actually executing the code. Try to understand what different sections of the code is doing and work out the answer using paper and pencil. This way may seems to be slow and unnecessary, but it will reinforce you skills in understanding the program and eventually **designing programs with ease**. :)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14582686253426339.png\n\n\n

Thank you.\n\nI made 2 mistakes. First of all I decided that I look at pseudocode.\n\nSecond, I actually tried to answer the question without watching videos (yes, bad habit) just based at my previous experience with Python where indentations matter.\n\nNow, when I watched videos I got question right.\n\nExcuse me.

hi **maxWen**,\n\nThanks for your comments. Changing the **`Choice`** types to **`String`** variables could be one of the ways to improve code readability other than writing documentations. However, this will disallow us to use some more clever algorithms to solve the problem.\n\nIf you observe the basic table constructed by **Ricardo** in [**this post**][1], you will observe some kind of patterns which allows us to finish the implementation of the method in 4 lines of code, using number comparison. Moreover, **`String`** are reference types which should take up more memory space.\n\nFor small small programs like this lab, the influence might be negligible, but the consideration of time and space efficiency in industrial software is important and could make a significant difference. :)\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/55b91fc2a9a36e4e4e0023ec

thanks for the reference link Ricardo, Core Java is a great resource. \n\nwould an enum type be better suited than a string?  I read that enum can use '=='
56b9556317a62f05130006b4
The answer is a decimal number because Binary Numeric Promotion was applied to the operands of the operators. The Java Language Specification on the [**Binary Numeric Promotion**][1] section states that, for primitive types operands:\n\n>  - If either operand is of type double, the other is converted to    double.\n>    \n>  - Otherwise, if either operand is of type float, the other is converted    to float.\n>    \n>  - Otherwise, if either operand is of type long, the other is converted    to long.\n>    \n>  - Otherwise, both operands are converted to type int.\n\nThis is a very important concept and I remember I did it wrong in my first programming assignment when I was doing my first programming course. :P\n\nAnd, I couldn't really get how you come up with 6.4285714285714285714285714285714 as the answer, could you explain a bit more in detail? :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6.2

I'm going to have to say a radio(excuse me if that's already been said).  We understand that be turning the radio on and choosing a channel that the radio will make (hopefully) pleasant noise, but does anyone understand how a radio is able to "grab" a frequency out of the air and turn it into sounds? What about how the station can send sound out into the air and it only be heard at a certain frequency that only a radio can pick up?

Hi **Juan**,\n\nI believe this will be the case as the final exam takes up 50% of the total grade and you need at least 60% to get the verified certificate. However, if you are doing well enough on other assessments, it shouldn't be necessary for you to get all correct in the final exam for getting the cert. Moreover, there are many useful discussions in the forum so it shouldn't be hard to finish all the course materials before Apr 26.\n\nIf you are very sure that you wouldn't be able to finish the exam before the deadline, you may contact edX to see if they could arrange a refund by following the link suggested by **Ricardo** above. :)

Many thanks for replying, but that wasn't really my question. I worked out that the grader wants just the character after it rejected my answers in which I gave the character in quotes.\n\nI wasn't really asking about how the grader works but about how, in English, we should refer to the value of a char variable. If the grade is known to be X I would tend to write\n\nThe value of the char variable `grade` is 'X'.\n\nand not\n\nThe value of the char variable `grade` is X.\n\nMy question was whether I'm right, wrong or weird for thinking that way.\n\n  
56e3e0ba391ced050e0006b6
Thanks for the reply. I understood how the curly brackets can be used to disambiguate; my question was whether there is a style convention for how to indent when we choose to omit them.\n\nBut I think on reflection that you are saying that it is considered bad style to omit them. The quote you gave about "personal taste" seems to suggest not, but the two links to style conventions do both stipulate putting them in.\n\n(I do understand that always putting in the curly brackets in has the advantage that it ought to save us from making a certain kind of mistake. But what I'm asking is, if we choose to exercise our "personal taste" and omit them, whether it is good style to indent as in my first original example rather than the second. From what you've said, and two out of three of the links, it's looking as though good style demands that we always put them in, so perhaps the question doesn't arise.)

Hi, I'm Juan and I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. First of all, I would like to thank to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and especially to this teaching team. The lessons are very interesting and also very good organized. The environment is really stimulating.\nNow, I would like to ask something. I started the course three days ago, and I'm willing to finish it before 26 of April (the due date). My question is this: if I pay the verified certificate and for some reason I can't make it to the final exam before the 26, then I lost my opportunity to get the verified certificate (and also lost 50 dollars)?\nThanks,\nJuan

hi hackyshiv\n\n\nIMO, it will be more useful to use an IDE following this course because some projects in some exercises contain several classes to be loaded. So working with BlueJ or other IDE as [***eclipse***][1] will help you to manage the projects provided to an easier compilation and execution, instead of compiling classes and execute programs manually ( by invoking "javac" and "java" ). Also by using an IDE as eclipse will give you a point of view more professional about programming environment.\n\nAbout to be able to open the files from comp102's library, we are unable. Those files were already compiled and compressed into "jar", and we are not allow to open them and review their source codes.\n\n*note*: I not tried it, but you could could put all files into the same folder and check if the import statement is working in your linux when invoking "javac". \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/?osType=linux

One of the such examples might be a simple table lamp. We, as users, are interested only in switching it on and off, however we don't want and need to know the mechanics inside and detailed idea of how it works.\n\nAnother example is photocamera. People just pushing on the trigger to make pictures, whereas they have no idea about processes inside the camera. Even if someone will change or modify some hardware, it won't affect the trigger and the user could easily use the camera after changes were made.

It will give an error as no constructor with suitable parameters was found as it would result in ambiguity in execution of the program
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Well, according to definition a well-defined problem has 2 properties:\n1. It must have a solution.\n2. It must have a finite number of steps to solve the problem.\n\nSince, we don't know what is "the best way", this problem becomes ambigious. Different people can interpret and understand this problem differently from each other. Hence, I believe this probem is not well-defined, although it might have a solution and theoritically it might have some finite steps to solve it.

I would say a keyboard, be it for the computer or the musical instrument. I press some keys and expect their output be it musical or letters & numbers on a screen. But you usually don't consider how the process works behind the scenes to get us that result.
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
A live video switcher in television broadcasting for example. The interface is used to switch between the cameras. The switcher is an abstraction itself, as it doesn't bother with the cameras or the cameraman, only the videos and the output. Behind the scenes becomes completely irrelevant after the buttons are pushed.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think the problem is not so well defined for a clear answer. Some suggestions may be possible, but those rely largely on assumptions of "best way" and the locations. What are the parameters for "best way"? Shortest route? Fastest? Cheapest? Most comfortable? With some sights along the way? Or direct uninterrupted travel? A combination of these? Where exactly are we starting from and where exactly are we headed? Into the City of London directly, or is an airport closeby also acceptable? Are we even going to London, UK? Or do we want to go to London, ON which is in Canada, a whole other direction. How much can the travel cost? Theoretically we could go by private jet? But can we? I think in the end everyone is able to give an answer based on their own assumptions of the locations and travel options and what they themselves considered to be the "best way". But for a more objective answer, this problem would require additional specifications.

No because the only reasonable way other way will take the same distance. The only right thing to actually do is to ensure that you have sufficient transport speeds to get there.\n

Before the physics and science in ancient time for sailors even their ships and the way in which it moved was abstraction. Actually, us living in this world without a knowledge of physics is abstraction.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
it is clear from where to start and the destination and asked about the easiest way. but there is no specifications like any time constraints , budget constraints and by which means the person has to travel purely depends on the urgency of his journey or his safety and off course budget. there are more  parameters one should think of while solving these problems.

There are lots of example of data abstraction around us. we use many things in our day today's life, whose functionality is only know to us not the mechanism behind it that how it actually works. Like the mobile we use to communicate anyone around the world. many people only knows its functionality but not be aware of the processes involved in communication. Actually we are surrounded by these types of examples. other examples of data abstraction are television, vehicle we use, escalator, we only know there functionality not the mechanism how it works.

Code segment 1 Ans : should be an error. Because we have declared the array but have not given the memory to the array.
559a323da9a36edf340010b3
Code segment 5 - there is an error when you declare the array with its values int and then uses double.

@leofan I am still struggling with my question. If you can please drop a hint I will be glad. I can seem to figure out how it works. I had written all of the code but I only need to change the position of the X values. I want to complete week four by tomorrow but I am still struggling with week 3.
56d8dc7d4b860a04f800003d
The code is not entire correct as it is placing the two images at the same position. To change the position of the second image, you will wither need to update the x position of the second image to an appropriate value.\n\nThere are two ways that we can change the x position of a ColorImage. The first way is to change the x position directly by invoking a method through the ColorImage object. You can take a look into the CanvasObject class for the appropriate method. The second way is to change it indirectly by specifying the new position when invoking the **`add()`** method of the Canvas class.\n\nLinks to the Javadoc of the mentioned classes are here:\n\n[**CanvasObject**][1]\n\n[**Canvas**][2]\n\nLet us know if it can be solved or not! :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/CanvasObject.html\n  [2]: http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/Canvas.html

Might fail to compile or not execute anything at the end because the syntax is correct, but it just doesn't have a constructor that applies to it. I can also show a random number at the end. But my vote goes more to might not execute anything at the end but the program would still run and show no values.

As a gamer I would say any game interface. When I play a game like Call of Duty all I care about is that when I shoot another player the opponent dies. How the computer calculates if I hit the opponent and how many hits it takes for the opponent to die is (at first) none of my concern. \n\nThis also demonstrates that a little more knowledge about the workings behind the abstract can actually be very rewarding. In the case of the computergame knowing how the computer calculates hits lets me know how many times I have to hit the opponent before I can move on to the next opponent and thus improves my game.\n\nIn the before mentioned example of a car a little more knowledge of the workings of the engine behind the interface lets me know that I have to change the oil, or if the care makes certain noises it tells me that I have to replace the brake pads. This makes sure my car does not die on me, which is also very beneficial.

Hi **Sang-Joon**,\n\nSorry for the late reply as we would like to wait for more details before giving a response.\n\nThe course contents will be available(visible) for around 1 - 2 weeks more after March 29. However, you will not be able to submitted any graded assessments. So if you are aiming for a certificate, it would be a good idea to finish all the assessments before the deadline. Otherwise, you will still have 1 - 2 weeks time to complete the study after Mar 29. We have not confirm with edx on re-running schedules, but in case there is any news, we will inform learners through email.\n\nWe are glad that you like the course and we wish that you can learning a lot from it. Just let us know if you have further comments/doubts on the course. :)\n\n

hi **Marvest**,\n\nThat's a very good question!\n\nActually, we we type the number **0997328509** or any number starts with **0** (except for just a single **0**), Java will interpret it as a **Octal Integer Literal (i.e. a base 8 number)**. A base 8 number can only contain digits in the range **[0 - 7]**, this is analogous to the digit range [0 - 9] in the base 10 system. Since the base 8 number **0997328509** contains digits out of the valid range, Java reports a "integer number too large" error.\n\nFor further confirmation, we can reproduce the error by coding: \n\n> int i = 08;\n\nSo to actually produce a barcode with the value **0997328509**, we just need to pass **997328509** as an argument to the **`IO.outputBarcode(long)`** method.\n\nTo test if the produced barcode actually represents our specified value, we can upload the barcode to [**this site**][1]. You can also use the **`IO.inputbarcode()`** method for reading the generated barcode image, however, the leading zero will be removed as the method returns a long integer in decimal format.\n\nHope this answers your question. :)\n\n  [1]: http://www.onlinebarcodereader.com/

I coded in BlueJ to get my answer.  The compiler output the correct answers except that I did not put a decimal in one of the answers.  This is bceause the compiler did not put a decimal point.  I understand the double and float decimal argument but I went with the compilers answer anyway to play safe.  It turned out you guys wanted the theoretical answer instead.  There is no way for me to know that.  Since I did not put a decimal I got two/three. Can I get credit because it was the right answer?

Ciao Ricardo,\n\nthanks for your prompt answer.\nTo be (hopefully) clearer, the point is the following. How the compiler behaves when a method has, for example, input parameter like (int, double) and it is feeded with, for example, (int, int), or any other combination which does not match perfectly with the input parameter types.\n\nThanks upfront.\n\nGiacomo

The compiler will return an error message for sure.

hi Alanturing1988\n\nyes, \n\nthe class contains a couple of **constructors** ( ***same name as the class name*** ),or methods with the same name, but they are defined with arguments with different types.\n\nSo, when you invoke these constructors to create two objects by passing different parameters, then the java compiler has to decide which one must to use, by **matching types**  ( in the same sequence or order ) from arguments (defined in the constructor ) and the arguments passed.\n\nthis is called **Overloading** \n\nrevise this documentation:\n\n***Oracle. Java Language Specification (JLS). Chapter 8. Classes. 8.8.8. Constructor Overloading***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.8.8\n\n\n    \n\n> Overloading of constructors is identical in behavior to overloading of\n> methods (§8.4.9). The overloading is resolved at compile time by each\n> class instance creation expression (§15.9).\n\n\n***Oracle. Java Language Specification (JLS). Chapter 8. 8.4.9. Overloading***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.9\n\n>    If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or both inherited by a class, or one declared and one\n> inherited) have the same name but signatures that are not\n> override-equivalent, then the method name is said to be overloaded.\n>     \n>    This fact causes no difficulty and never of itself results in a compile-time error. There is no required relationship between the\n> return types or between the throws clauses of two methods with the\n> same name, unless their signatures are override-equivalent.\n>     \n>    When a method is invoked (§15.12), the number of actual arguments (and any explicit type arguments) and the compile-time types of the\n> arguments are used, at compile time, to determine the signature of the\n> method that will be invoked (§15.12.2). If the method that is to be\n> invoked is an instance method, the actual method to be invoked will be\n> determined at run time, using dynamic method lookup (§15.12.4).\n\n\nmore examples:\n\n* http://www.leepoint.net/JavaBasics/oop/oop-45-constructor-overloading.html\n\n* https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Overloading_Methods_and_Constructors\n\n* http://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/constructor-overloading/\n\nhope was helpful

The question is asking what are numbers to test the program is working.  Grades can only be from 0 to 100.  So I shouldn't be able to enter anything that would not be a grade.  If I enter 9,000,000, well, that's not a grade.  So I want to challenge the program to make sure it works.\n\nI really can't say anymore without giving away the answer.  Check to see if it accepts valid inputs, and also check to see if it accepts invalid inputs.  In programming we call this simple validation.

[ but the point to be corrected is here, because **the method allows ant integer without any error message or exception** ].\n\nthis course does not cover exceptions as you are trying to do with your initial if-else\n\n***you must assume that the user's input must to be in that range [0,2]***\n\nif you run the **demo program** as input e.g. "5" you will get an exception\n\n![][2]\n\nto solve that, you could implement this method like:\n\n>     public void makeChoice() {\n>         IO.outputln("Please input your choice (0=rock, 1=paper, 2=scissors)");\n>         int type = IO.inputInteger(); \n> \n>         if ( type < 3 && type >= 0 ) {\n>             choice = new Choice(type); } \n>         else {        \n>             System.out.println("Please make sure your option is in range [0,2]"); \n>             System.exit(0);\n>         }\n>     }\n\nand exit to the program.\n\nor create a try-catch exception in this line : **player.showChoice(canvas);``**\n\n**3)** in **Computer.class** you will have to implement the same method into **task 03**\nbut in that case must use a random number between 0 and 2, so there is **no possibility of error**.\n\n\n**4)** finally to complete the **`compareWith(Choice anotherChoice)'s method`**\nin **Choice.class**, you must also **assume that both types are into range [0,2]**\n\nso according with your point, an initial "if ( in range ) { ....} else {}" statement is **unnecessary**... check this structure ( [*provided in the comment above*][3] )\n\n\n\n\n![][4]\n\n\nhope was helpful\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14563168088336855.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1456317294793237.png\n  [3]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/566d5e78f34608f77a000233\n  [4]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14501098523801248.png

So what I have done is remove my last else if() statement and replaced it with an else() statement which reads \n\n    else {\n        return -2;\n    }\nBut I feel like it's really poorly written because I have no error checking in there. I suppose I could begin the code with something like if(this.type is within a given integer range and anotherChoice.type is within same integer range) {run the rest}, else {throw an error}. But then I feel like I'm creating the same problem over again.\n

For example washing machine with its every methods. Other think is microvave and oven. That was near-life types of abstraction. But on the other hand we might take a look at list or vector class from C++ with its public member methods. We just use them without any knowledge of that how they were implemented.

hi \n\nplease read all these documentation, to understand what is a "constructor" [  the answer to your question is marked in bold ]\n\n\n***Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. Providing Constructors for Your Classes***\n\n  * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html  \n\n> A class contains constructors that are invoked to create objects from\n> the class blueprint.

You\n> cannot write two constructors that have the same number and type of\n> arguments for the same class, because the platform would not be able\n> to tell them apart. Doing so causes a compile-time error.\n>     \n>    **You don't have to provide any constructors for your class, but you must be careful when doing this.

I think compiler cannot identify which constructor must be used, because first constructor hopes an integer and a double, and second hopes a double and an integer.\n\nFor me a posible solution is: first constructor must receive an integer and a double. new Week3Quiz(10, 10.0);\nand second constructor must receive a double and an integer. new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10).

How was said, it is not well-defined problem because of the definition of "the best way". My first thought was obviously "the fastest" but on the other hand it may be "the cheapest" or "the most comfortable". If we want to be able to solve this problem we should have more informations.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The code could not compile because the parameters do not match the constructor. Therefore, the program has an error that needs to be fixed.

Since it is about 5 week's time to the deadline of both courses, we would recommend you to finish part 1 first. However, if you find the materials in part 1 easy to follow and can complete it in about 2 week's time, it shouldn't be a problem for you to finish part 2 before the deadline.\n\nPlease let us know if you have further doubts! :)

Thank you very much. So let me summarize here: \nThe instance variable x is declared first, and so set by default value 0 by the java program. Later on, within the Quiz1 method, the L.H.S. x find the matching variable, which is the local variable - the parameter x within the 'closest' scope. The R.H.S. x is a value assigned to L.H.S. x, instead of a variable, and the only value initialized and assigned to a variable named x, is zero by default. Thus, the final output is x.

In line 17, constructor IronMan, should not have the return type void before it;\nIn line 18, the value should be assigned to the parameter, it is reversed;\nIn line 21, I wonder String can be a return type of the method or not, if yes,\nIn line 22, there should be a return there in order to return a string instead of printout the output by IO.outputln;\nIn line 25, 29, both of the method are lack of the return type: since the names of the constructors must be the same as the class, they could not be the constructor. Where the first one should be void, and the second one should be int, the second one even loss the java keyword 'return' before it.\nIn line 33, the getName() method should not use the return value void, since it returns a string, and once again I am not sure whether string can be a return type here. However, should be yes, by search.\nIn line 42, the new IronMan() loss its parameter, without it, will cause an error match.\n

The code as is will produce an error. In line 5, the constructor "Week3Quiz" set the first number to be integer and the second to be a double. When q3 is later defined as a new constructor with the values "(10.0, 10.0)" the first parameter will produce the error because an integer cannot be a double.

Take care to use semicolons and upper and lower cases correctly. IO-output must be IO.outputln. In order to get it running it is required to have *import comp102x.IO;* first. I can import it in CourseGrade project. Is it possible to import it in a different project folder too?\nThanks all!

I tried slogging my way through this problem in the regular way and got 7 of 9 numbers right and then realized the best way to solve any complicated problem is to simplify it. The first step in doing that is realizing what makes it complicated - in this case it's the shadowing of a's and b's, and also getting tripped up by the second instance of Scope1.\nWhat I did is rename all a, b, and c variables with distinct variable names, each starting with the letter they're replacing to make it easier, then I listed each separate instance, side by side, with their respective variables and methods. Then I stepped through the program crossing out old values and replacing them with new values. This helped me see what I did wrong the first time. Hopefully it helps.

hi **cnayak**,\n\nActually, the program would print out some array elements and the fully qualified name of the exception in the console if there is an invalid array index used.  Since exception is not covered in this course, the grader just expect us to input "**error**" if there is **any** error when running the code.

I think computers themselves are very good example, because we know how to press a key on a keyboard but behind that screen and keyboard we don't know whats going on. That is someone else's job to do not mine and that is why we pay for someone to make it easier for us.

in first submission i wrote error with quotation. and dan in second submission i wrote the output in consloe. and the question is "What would be the output on the console after executing the following code segment?" So the system must say both answer correct. error as well as  123error.  In console it will print the values at array[3]array[4]array[5] and the shows error at array[6]. So the output in the console will be value at "234error" if int[] array = {2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 4}; and so i think my answer is correct. The system that checks answer should consider both possibility whether my answer is error or 234error, it must show correct

The hoverboard can be the example of an abstraction. It's so popular nowadays and people of all ages are using it but not many stop to think about the internal set up which allows it to move.\n\nSome other examples I thought of were smartphone, watch, microwave, car and fire extinguisher.\n\nI'm glad this discussion was created. The language of the text was pretty complicated with a lot of new words for someone like me who has no background in Java or programming. But these examples really help in understanding the concept.

hi  SLSprong\n\nif you open **`Choice.class`**,  you can see that **`"type"`** is an **instance variable** and **not** a **method()**\n\nInstructions :\n\n>    2 . **The instance variable, type**, in a Choice instance has values 0, 1, or 2 which represent Rock, Paper and Scissors respectively.\n>\n>    3 . **Obtain the instance variable, type,** of the current Choice instance and that of the other Choice instance, anotherChoice. Compare the two\n> type,...\n\n\nuse **`this.type`** as a value to be compared instead of **`this.type()`**, to fix the error.\n\n\nhope was helpful\n\n\n**note** : also it will be better if you use the general structure : **`if (...) {...} / else if (...) {...} / else {...}`** to avoid other compilation errors

Hi, **astridmaria**. All the demo programs and program templates are compressed in a .zip file. You will have to decompress it before opening them with BlueJ. If you have already done this step and it still doesn't work, please let know the steps you followed to open the file and list out any error messages you encountered.\n\nWe would love to make the materials more accessible and friendly. While the edX platform supports html components in a native manner, support for Java is limited. We are not able to embed a code editor on the course website with it linked to our grading system and communicate with the learner's learning progress system at the same time. Hopefully, the platform will provide more support for different kinds of programming languages later.\n\nAlso note that Java is a more sophisticated language than HTML. So it would require more effort in order to learn it thoroughly. However, once you have mastered it, you will find most of the programming languages easy to pick up.\n\nKeep us posted of any difficulties you are encountering, we are here to help. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://d37djvu3ytnwxt.cloudfront.net/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/Lab_01.zip\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/f792f3a2057040aa959e606d687e9bc4/

Abstraction is a concept that can be applied to almost everything we interact with. His is not limited to complex or modern technology. A book, for example, through the use of printed text transmits ideas and information from the author to the reader. The reader does not have to understand the mechanics of how language works, or how the brain interprets symbols from picture into word into idea. Nor does the reader have to have an understanding of book construction, or light absorption caused by the ink. All the reader has to think about is the words on the page. As long as that core objective of transmitting information remains viable, all of the rest of the components of a book can be changed or updated, but it still works.

The question is not well defined. What is implied by the term "the best way"? Is it the fastest, the cheapest, the most comfortable journey or the most interesting method of getting there? Does time of arrival and departure matter with the method of travel?\n\nAnd although London is mentioned as the destination, I'm aware that there's a London in Canada as well. The question doesn't specify the country.\n\nThese reasons suggest that the question is poorly defined.

Hey all,\n\nMy name is Shaheen. I reside in UAE and am a doctor by education. I have no prior experience with programming or computer languages except learning BASIC in school. I'm doing this course purely out of curiosity and interest because I enjoy learning new things. If a course in CSS would be added, I'd definitely be interested in joining that as well.\n\nI understand that this Java course is for beginners but does it require some reading prior to starting the course in order to follow along? I hope I'm able to catch up with the rest of you and I'm presuming I'll be asking for a lot of help in the discussion forums being so new to this.\n\nExcited and looking forward to learning Java!

hi cnayak\n\nyou are mixing concepts,....\nwhen you are creating ( declare and initializing ) an object from a class with a constructor, the syntax has to be :\n\n\n    \n>           v "type is not found"\n>  < Type/class > objectName = new < Type/class > ( constructor's arguments\n> if needed ) ;\n\n\nin your case the object's type is missing [ 1st error ]\n\nyou could use, e.g :\n\n    \n\n> Circle c = new Circle ( a, b);\n\nor\n\n>     Circle c;\n>     \n>     c = new Circle ( a, b );\n\n\nabout the second and third errors, they are the same :\n\n\nyour statement is the API definition for the constructor, giving information about type of arguments to be passed to create an object.\n\n    \n>                          v "give some errors"\n> ...  = new Canvas ( int width , int height );\n\nso, the parameters passed must be a couple of integers themself ( the "type" is not needed ), e.g. :\n\n    \n>                         v "integers must be passed"\n> Circle c = new Circle ( 10 , 20 );\n\nrevise the instructions, the integers passed can be returned by reading images's information ( get...() )\n\n\nmay be you can also read this thread ( it presents same errors )\n\n***lab4 task3***\n\n* https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m4a/threads/55c888f5a9a36eea62002e4a\n\n\nlet us know if you cold fix your problem\n\n\n:)

My utilization of my hands to type this response represents a form of natural abstraction. The complex interactions between the frontal cortex and primary motor cortex in deciding what to type and triggering muscle contractions that culminate in a response to this question.

I believe this problem is not "well defined" due to the limitations intrinsic to the wording. Establishing what "well defined" means such as most economic or fastest would better define the question allowing one to properly establish contraints on travel.

The comp102x library is not a standard library of the Java language. So in order to use it, you will have to place the comp102x library, together with its dependencies in a folder named "+libs" inside the BlueJ project folder. The libraries can be found from the Resources page. The download link, **"Library of package comp102x"**, can be found at the bottom of the page.\n\nPlease let use know if you have further doubts! :)

Firstly,the constructor defined should not return any value.\na function which has a void return type should not return anything,but in one of the function it returns.\nthe way functions are written are wrong.\n

Yes, I agree with your analysis, it's true am not very familiar with any London anywhere or with Hong Kong, but I think that if the problem specification included a clause like "other conditions like flight delay times and so on"being neglected, but again this would mean not being in a real world. So I thing the Problem is not well-defined.\n

I believe you are referring to the exercise on [**animating the football**][1]:\n\nYes, the goal is a bit tricky to shoot. One trick is to shoot multiple balls by clicking the mouse a few times so that when the goal "blinks", we will have a change to score.\n\nNevertheless, the main objective of this activity is to use a for loop for animating the football. As long as you can implement the for loop correctly, you will be able to observe the shooting animation. :)\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/courseware/3f0585f6e4574bac95384a227d50ef5f/b32b4cb073dd4cca8364ade5ad94e0d3/8

I can think  of abstraction in cooking recipes. A recipe for example of cooking fried rice  may vary for every cook using the same ingredients. However the outcome is the same. Another example, in mathematics problem can be solved in many ways but the final answer is same. This is also an example of abstraction as implementation is not important here as long as the solution is right.

Still tying to understand.\n\nIf I want to heal a skin condition, then doing so could be very complex and time consuming if I had to do this from first principles. I would have to determine a herb with appropriate healing properties, find that herb and harvest it, prepare a concoction by processing the plant to extract it's healing substance and combine that with other ingredients so it can be applied to my skin (and stay there). \n\nBut, if I understand correctly, all this complexity has been abstracted away, all I need to do is go to the store and buy an ointment to apply to my skin.\n\nIs this correct?

This problem is not well defined manner because some likes to choose cheapest ways and other likes to choose comfortable ways. But there is no particular solution to reach London from Hong Kong. For instance, If you choose most comfortable way like plane then it should be late or cancel due to some natural calamities or something else. We can use salesman travelling problems fro getting a better solutions but it might not be a comfortable way to reach there.\n\nSo we can not say that there is not any "Best Way" to travel from Hong Kong to London.

The use of a microwave oven. Our package of food (I use that term loosely) provides us with instructions on how to prepare it utilizing a microwave. Our minds lead us to the various functions as indicated by the box (or through previous experience) on cook time and the need to use a pre-set function (defrost). We don't need to know how it produces and regulates it's heat in order to utilize it as outlined on our food package.

Pretty much every semi-advanced machine in the world uses the principle of abstraction :)\n\n - A **key** turned to open a door\n - A **clock** (pretty complex mechanism that we don't know anything about)\n - A **refrigerator** (you just open the door and put things inside)\n - A **toilet** lever :)\n - A **lamp** with a switch\n - Even your **deodorant** (you just wear it... if you do :P )\n - I would even say that a **sausage** fits the definition, but that would be taking the concept too far...

It's not a well defined problem in the sense that it's too broad. As WangYuen put it better:\n\nDoes "best" mean:\n\n - cheapest\n - fastest\n - more comfortable\n - easier\n - most beautiful scenery\n\n\nWhen people are thought to define their goals, they are usually told to define **SMART goals**. SMART stands for:\n\n - Specific\n - Measurable\n - Achievable\n - Realistic\n - Time bound\n\nSo, following that rule, you should be able to constrain the goal to a more SMART goal, such as:\n\n- *What is the cheapest way to get from HK to London in the first week of March (any date and time will do, but the travel/transit time should not last longer than 4 days), for a young couple (F+M) without health restrictions, who hold a Canadian passport (both persons)?* \n

The compiler will complain attempting to execute q3: in fact, in this case there is a type conversion from double to int, which needs explicitely type casting. However, q4 could be allowed, since in this case the implicit conversion would work (an int is assigned to a double).

hi jose\n\nwelcome 
559bdba3b30d843e96001168
[Oops, I posted a new entry and then I foudn this one... I copy/paste it here]\n\n**Hi all, I'm Jose :)** and I live in **Colombia**\n\nI just started with the course.\n\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I have two engineering degrees. I've coded for a long time. \n\nI learned with C++ at college long, long ago (I forgot all about syntax in C++ because it's been a long time since I used it).\n\nThen, I used Matlab and VBA (for MS Office) a lot during college.\n\nThen, I became involved with web things, so I learnt some HTML, CSS, adn ActionScript3 (Flash/Flex). I've played around with php/MySql as well. From time to time, I have to learn "new" languages, for instance I automate my daily tasks in Google Sheets' own flavor of JavaScript (GAS)\n\nBUT, even though I feel pretty comfortable "creating" algorithms, I lack a lot of formal structure about programming: I don't know much about creating scalable and maintanable programs, I don't know how to interact efficiently with a database, I don't know much about programming patterns, etc.\n\nI would like to become a real expert in Java, for instance, but, to date, I'm uncapable even to write a "Hello World!" program. Let alone compiling an executable... :P\n\nSo, here I am. I think I can do this first course very fast, as I'm kind of experienced (but I don't really have much time)\n\n**Good luck to everybody, and thanks to HKUSTx**

This example is actually inspired by all the students here . many have talked about some appliance and a remote  . I would here state about the remote itself , where the design of the buttons are a separate task and the battery ( power house of the remote  ) is separate task and thus an abstraction .

Sorry, I couldn't quite catch your question. Do you mean compiling the Java programs using the command line interface? Although it is possible, but we would still recommend you to use BlueJ or other IDEs as it will save more time and reduce the chance of errors. :)

Hi **Random_Rumba**,\n\nActually we did not intent to make the exercise to be very mathematical as the main purpose of it is for learners to get some experience on using the Math library of Java. Therefore, we have provided the formulas and the main task for learners will be to translate it into Java code.\n\nHowever, we agreed that the exercise's clarity will be improved if it is also mathematically correct and most importantly, it will help learners to understand better. So, we would like to take your suggestion on flipping the diagram vertically.\n\nThe corresponding page is updated now: **[Graded Problem Task 3][1]**\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. :)\n\nCOMP 102x Teaching Team\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/courseware/b57525ba4b974719b9ce4eca914e1c39/d0c0db73763e42d4a1a88ba670b11eda/3?activate_block_id=block-v1:HKUSTx%2bCOMP102.1x%2b4T2015%2btype@vertical%2bblock@10f4bda69bff4e908e9f015831982fbe/3

The diagram you have there is for the "normal" mathematical orientation of the axes, where the positive y direction is up, and angles are measure anticlockwise from the positive x axis. For computer graphics the positive y direction is down, so your diagram needs to be flipped vertically, and angles then are measured clockwise from the positive x axis.

Very nice \n\n

No, 'the best way' should be defined first.
56b2ebd62d96fe05160003ec
Yes - that's the easy minimal change which makes the diagram technically correct. But if the aim is to produce the diagram most likely to promote understanding, I still think it would be better to flip the diagram vertically, so that the angle of rotation is positive rather than negative.

The first and second arguments of the constructor are the width and the height of the ColorImage.class's object created in step 2.1\n\n* **2.3** display/put the ColorImage.class's object ( 2.1 ) on the Canvas.class's object ( 2.2 ) by using the **add() method of the Canvas.class**.\n\n\nOnly three lines of code are necessary to complete this task, or better to say, to implement loadAnImage()'s method.\n\nAs you learned in previous lectures, jave uses the keyword new to "instantiating a class" or the same thing as "creating an object." When you create an object, you are creating an "instance" of a class, therefore "instantiating" a class.\n\nBy using new to call to a constructor. For example :\n\n    \n\n> Point p = new Point(23, 94);\n\n\nsometimes the class provides a constructor which doesn't take any arguments, so it's called a no-argument constructor. In general ( not strictly), we also call that constructor as **default constructor**. For instance :\n\n    \n\n> Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();\n\nplease, revise this documentation:\n\n**Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. Creating Objects**\n\n\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/objectcreation.html\n\n    \n\n> The Rectangle constructor used in the following statement doesn't take\n> any arguments, so it's called a no-argument constructor:\n> \n> \n>        Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();\n> \n> \n> \n> All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not\n> explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a\n> no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

hi benarbe1\n\nnice point, have a look :\n\nthis is the **BankAccount.class**\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n... and into the class is defined a method ( main() ) just to test if the class is working correctly, **this is not a normal practice in java programing**, because you normally define classes and then you use a program ( with a shell or a main() method ) to create objects from those classes and work with them.\n\nin this case **"main()" method is another method defined INTO the class**, so you can invoke instance variables without using accessor o getters methods.\n\n\n...now we are going to revise what **ENCAPSULATION** means:\n\n\n    \n***Tutorialspoint. Java - Encapsulation***\n\n* http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_encapsulation.htm\n\n\n>    Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n>     \n>    Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as as single unit. In encapsulation the variables of a class will be hidden\n> from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of\n> their current class, therefore it is also known as data hiding.\n>     \n>    To achieve encapsulation in Java\n>     \n>    - Declare the variables of a class as private.\n>     \n>    - Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.\n\n\n... and something that we have learned in this course :\n\n\n\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\nas D. TC Pong has summarized:\n\n    \n\n> an instance variable can be seen by all methods/constructors in the\n> class ( in this class "main" is another method in the class, so all instance variables can be invoked directly because they are visible ). Visibility to other classes depends on access modifiers ( so if the instance variables are declared as private are hiding to external classes, and you will need to invoke accessor methods to get them >> ENCAPSULATION  ).\n\n**sample 01. Error**\n\n*External classes cannot access directly to instance variables declared as private*\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\n**sample 02**\n\n*External classes can access to instance variables by invoking getter/accessor methods*\n\n![enter image description here][4]\n\n\nhope was helpful\n\n:)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14544338621973836.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14544334424768805.png\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14544355555211408.png\n  [4]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14544360405833079.png

Hi **asnip**,\n\nNote that Java is **case sensitive**. In Lab 01 Graded Task 1, you will have to output the first line exactly as:\n\n>     Hello, world!\n\nThe second line must be:\n\n>     Hello, XXX!\n\nwith XXX replaced with the words of your own choice. Be aware that you will still need to keep the exclamation mark.\n\nFor the third line, you can output anything.\n\nDon't be discouraged and keep it up! Patience is the key to learn programming successfully. :)

I definitely think the question should be more detailed.

This could be interpreted differently by each individual, so it definitely should be a more detailed question.

I have just started module 4 and I do not understand all of the code but what I can see is that the general structure of the class is "upside down" ans as a result it becomes difficult to see the flow of statements in an orderly fashion. The bad structure of the program results in variables being passed from one statement to an other. I have compiled the program and have come to the same answers as most people here.

Hi **nicolasteixeirac**, you may wish to look into the Javadoc of the Random class, especially the nextInt() method. Here is the link:\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Random.html#nextInt-int-\n\nRemember to test you code in BlueJ before submitting to the online grader!\n\nLet us know if you can figure it out. :)

So am I right to summarise if I look at the ColorImage.html:\n\n "Constructor Summary" is related directly **to the class**, is this instance "public class ColorImage(Constructor and Description);"\n\nAnd:\n\n"Method Summary" is related directly to objects created **from this class**, in the above that would be "image1". So I can use "image1(Method and Description);"\n\nPerhaps I find this confusing because both the operands and the values are defined in ColourImage.class inside the comp102X package to which I do not have access without de-compiling the comp102x package and the ColourImage.class files.\n\nMany thanks for your explanation and was able to pass all the assignments in Lab03. What puzzled me for sometime was that inside BlueJ the compiler did not throw me an error as it would have added the default constructor, but the grader did.\n\nRegards,\n\nHerman

Thank you,\n\nI was under the impression that I had to code the constructor with arguments to load the correct picture.\n\nI did not realise that the grader would select the picture for me.\n\nBeing new to programming I find it hard to memorise the different terms used and as such it is difficult to understand the syntax used in ColorImage.html as I am not always clear what the arguments refer to.\n\nHerman

Human body is another cage of abstraction. Like many other living materials. We host many functionalities within ourselves, which occurs at its own pace and style. All we do is eat, sleep, and control our surroundings in accordance with our body. The rest is occurring inside it and we don't really need slightest intervention to make that happen.

Perhaps let me share a bit more on this tricky case. :)\n\n___\n\nLet's consider the following code:\n\n>     byte a = 2;\n>     byte b = 2;\n>     byte c = 2;\n>     \n>     byte d = a * b / c;\n>     byte e = 2 * 2 / 2;\n\n___\n\nWhen we compile the code in BlueJ, we will receive an error of <i>**incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte**</i> in the statement:\n\n> byte d = a * b / c;\n\nThe reason is that when we perform arithmetic operations using arithmetic operators like: **`+, -, *, / ...`**, Java will automatically convert the pair of operands to the appropriate types. For example, if either of the operands is a **`double`**, the other one will also be converted to **`double`** if it is not already one. **Moreover, both operands will at least be promoted to `int` type.** (Reference: [Java Language Specification 5.6.2][1]).\n\nTherefore, values represented by the variables **`a`**, **`b`** and **`c`** are all converted to **`int`**, which makes the expression being evaluated to an **`int`** value of 2, and cannot be assigned to a **`byte`** variable. To make it work, we can **apply a casting to the entire expression** like the following:\n\n> byte d = (byte) (a * b / c);\n\n___\n\nOn the other hand, the statement:\n\n> byte e = 2 * 2 / 2;\n\nwill not generate any compilation error. This is because Java allows a **`byte`** variable to be initialized with an integer literal (i.e. a fixed value) in the range of -128 to 127. Since the compiler could optimize the integer literal expression into a single integer literal, no compilation error is generated in the above statement.\n\nHowever, an error will be generated if the integer literal expression is evaluated to a value out of the **`byte`** range. For example:\n\n> byte f = 2 * 2 * 32;\n\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6.2

From what you have written, it is likely that the program is waiting for the user to enter some number in the terminal window before it continues the execution. However, the user will not be aware of that if we do not output a prompt message in the first place. So what you will have to do here is rearrange your program structure so that the program will ask the user what number he/she wants to input first before allowing the user to input the number.\n\nLet us know if you can figure it out! :)\n\n

I think I solved the problem. I downloaded the folder "Library of package comp102x" from the Resources page added it to the same ColorImage folder, and now the ColorImageDemo compiles. There may be other files missing though, and I no longer know where I downloaded the ColorImage folder in the first place!!

This leaves me confused for this assignment.\nThe default constructor for class Lab03 would than be:\n\n    public Lab03(){};\n\nAnd as I understand the following code would then be valid for task 01\n\n\n>     import comp102x.ColorImage;\n>     import comp102x.Canvas;\n>     \n>     public class Lab03\n>     {  \n>         public Lab03(){};\n>     \n>         public void loadAnImage() \n>         {\n>             // Please write your code after this line\n>             ColorImage image1 = new ColorImage("A.jpg"); //Create image1 object\n>             Canvas canvas = new Canvas( ... ,  ...); //Create canvas object\n>             canvas.add(...); //Display image on canvas\n>         }\n>     }\n\nIs this true?\n\nI cannot declare the default constructor inside the constructor:\n\n    public void loadAnImage() \n    {\n        // Please write your code after this line\n        public Lab03(){};\n        \n        my code.........\n        \n    }\n\nAs than the compiler tells me that "public Lab03(){};"  -illegal start of expression-\n\nI have to submit my code after the\n\n    // Please write your code after this line\n\nTherefore my score can never be 1/1 for task 01 as I cannot submit the default constructor inside the area to be submitted.\n\nOr am I completely wrong here?\n\n

It's not well defined because if one were to travel by various methods then it is possible to find an infinite combination of routes/methods. Since the problem is not well defined and no parameters set, the number of possibilities is too large.

Thanks for the quick response, but it doesn't work.

hi Herman Verhagen\n\n**strictly** the term "default constructor" refers to a constructor provided by java when there are no constructors defined into the class, this "default constructor" is automatically generated by java, to allow you to create objects or instances of its class. This "default constructor" does not take arguments.\n\n**in general**, we also use the term "default constructor" to the constructor designed into the class which does not take arguments.\n\nI leave you some links :\n\n*Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. Providing Constructors for Your Classes*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html\n\n    \n\n> You don't have to provide any constructors for your class, but you\n> must be careful when doing this. **The compiler automatically provides a\n> no-argument, default constructor for any class without constructors.**\n> This default constructor will call the no-argument constructor of the\n> superclass. In this situation, the compiler will complain if the\n> superclass doesn't have a no-argument constructor so you must verify\n> that it does.

hi alexantosh,\n\nBasically, if we are not handling anything heavy weighted, we can perform the action inside the **Event Dispatch Thread** without creating a worker thread. And the good news is that, Java has handled most part of it for us. According to your description, all we need to do is to add an **ActionListener** to the comboBox. Whenever a choice is being selected, the **actionPerformed()** method of the ActionListener will be invoked to perform certain actions in the **Event Dispatched Thread**, for example, changing the text being displayed on a JPanel. This programming paradigm is called the **event-driven programming paradigm**, where the program stops and waits until some event occurs. I won't go too deep in this topic here as **event-driven programming** is covered in [part 2 of the course][1]. Let me also give you an extra reference specifically related to using comboboxes in Java:\n\n\n**How to Use Combo Boxes**\n___\nhttps://www.edx.org/course/introduction-java-programming-part-2-hkustx-comp102-2x-0\n\n  [1]: https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-java-programming-part-2-hkustx-comp102-2x-0

Hi tundeiness,\n\nFor the first question, it seems that you are submitting the entire class instead of just the method definition. This is the reason why the grader reports that there is no method found and the grading cannot be proceeded.\n\nFor the second question, from the message returned by the grader, it seems that the pattern produced by your code is missing something important which is visualized by the paragraph mark (¶).

Its a well-defined problem, because solution is exist, and we can finish it a finite number of steps. That's all.\n\nThe meaning of best way are individual for everyone. It's depend on person. Someone prefer comfort more that money. Someone worries about time. Someone don't care about time and thinking just about saving money. Check it with yourself. In program style it can look like a little survey, before we got a solution. You should choose it. There are can be 2-3 options.

A well-defined problem would have restrictions. Any real world scenario would have a multitude of dynamic factors. These would cause the scenario to have no limits. A simulation for " Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" would give countless answers depending on the starting condition and the factors we include in the process.  Thus, a well-defined problem would give a definite start point, a set number of factors out of which no other factors would affect the result.

hi cugado\n\nI will put another example, imagine that in your supermarket if your purchase is above 40€, you will receive your purchase in your address without any cost.\n\nI you have to define a small code, you have to determine what happens if the customer buys products for an exactly value of 40€.\n\n>     if (value ???? 40) then free delivery\n\nis 40€ **inclusive** (>=) or **exclusive** (>) ?\n\nso there are some additional cases to be checked....\n\n\n----------\n\n... if you design a small piece of code to revise that. To evaluate if the program is running correctly, then you will need to check : eg: **1)** values less than 40 , **2)** values bigger than 40 and **3)** lastly the situation value = 40.

So you have time enourg to complete this part.\n\nrevise the previous leofan's comment at this thread:\n\n    \n\n> ... the course is designed to be finished in 5 weeks,\n\n\n\n... about "**COMP102.2x**" that is starting soon, is into self pace mode,... and you will have also got time to complete this "Part2" after completing "Part1". You could revise the deadline for Part2 ( time enough to complete it ).\n\nso cheer up

To have a well defined statement, we should not be subjective.\nIn this case, the expression "best way" is subjective and depends on the personal judgment and preferences of each person.\nAs other answers mentioned, we might be more specific and change the expression "best way" with cheapest, fastest, the  most comfortable, most secure,... but even these words might differe from person to another. \nFor example, "cheapest" is better defined with "that costs 100 $.

When we, as human,  use oral communication and aural listening. For most of us the mechanics of producing sound waves and then converting the sound waves back into signals our brains interpret is the abstraction.  We only at times may need to train our brains to assign new meanings to the new sounds in learning a language.

what am trying to do is simple.  I have  a JPanel, and combobox on a JFrame. the panel's text is being changed according to the selected combo box option. But i have noticed that after one choice is picked, the text keeps on being changed, its as the same choice is being selected without stopping. \nSo, after selecting that choice, how do i ensure that after the text has been changed, the program stops and waits for me to make another choice? Is the threads the only way to go about this? They seem a little too much for this.

hi can you please review your marking scheme on the exams? especially the coding parts. my first and second code in the exam ran very well in my IDE and i think i deserve some marks for them not outright zero as the computer has given me. please i'm begging you to review my codes. Thank you.

The best way to travel from Hong Kong to London would be by car. Because if it happened any obstacle in the way I would have several options. Sleep in a hotel, opt for new routes, and more. With that I would take advantage of the best travel and, and arrive at my destination safely as planned ..

To achieve what you are saying, we will need the concept of concurrency. Java allows "concurrent execution" of **Threads**, in the Java virtual machine by assigning CPU time to the threads alternately. So, if two different threads are running the GUI and the method you specified, you can terminate the method by killing the method thread while keeping the GUI alive.\n\nIn Java, it is suggested that the GUI components are created and executed under a special thread named the **Event Dispatched Thread** while the execution of other tasks should be put into worker threads.\n\nConcurrency is an advanced topic in Java, so we won't go very deep here. But if you are interested, you can read the following tutorials from Oracle:\n\n**Concurrency:**\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/\n\n**Concurrency in Swing:**\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/index.html\n

One example I can think of is a book bag. We know that the purpose of a book bag is to contain items for school, the gym etc. In order for a book bag to do its job it needs different sections, zippers, pockets etc. So we know what each compartment is for but we don't focus on how the compartments work to keep different items contain within the book bag. Another example is a tablet. We know what we need in a tablet such as an on/off swicth a screen that allows you to cause the tablet to do different things and so on. But we don't need to know how it does it if you are focusing on data abstraction.

Java compiler provides a default constructor to a class when no constructor is declared in a class. Since we have declared a constructor in a class, no default constructor will be provided to a class. During compilation time compiler doesn't get the constructor with 2 parameter as double and hence compilation fails occurs.

Great example of abstraction in the real life is interacting with a girl. For example, you invite one for a coffee or to cinema. No matter what the answer will be, there is a lot of things going on behind the 'curtains'. And even if the answer is 'Yes' you still might ask yourself 'why?' or 'how?'.

Dear pianoclassforkids,\n\nWe appreciate for your valuable comments on the course materials. Although, due to the development cycle, we would not be able to refine some of the materials now, we are willing to make appropriate changes in future offerings of the course so that students can learn better. So please let us know if you have further suggests on the course, we are happy to listen to them. :)

There are many other cases of these mis-transcribed words in the earlier lessons, and these don't bother me. But here is another example that may be particularly troublesome from the same lesson as my previous comment. The word iteration refers to a a single case of a repeated process, clearly a source of confusion when discussing a loop. The initialization is what is executed only once, not the iteration. The use of the word evaluation in this particular context is technically correct, but it could lead to confusion which could be avoided by using another word like applied, since there is a conditional statement evaluation that occurs in a for loop.\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nI hope you don't get mad a me for pointing out these transcription errors. They don't bother me. I can figure out what you mean, and I like this course in general because I can tell that you are very careful with your choice of words which I like very much. But you probably did not do the transcribing yourself, and the transcriber was not as careful.\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14527287664421324.png

I agree with JohnDoe9007. It took a bit to confirm how Main returned 5 for c until I realized that method Two contained no local definition of c which meant it must be setting the class's instance of c.

The following bugs exist in the definition of the IronMan class:\n\nline 17:  The constructor has been given a void return type. A constructor should not have any return type.\n\nline 21:  dance() should have a void return type, not String.\n\nline 25:  cleanSlateProtocol() should have a void return type.\n\nline 29:  setId(int) should have a void return type.\n\nline 33:  getName() should have a String return type, not void.\n\nline 42:  The default constructor has not been defined. The compiler will not create a default contructor because another constructor with an argument has been defined. Therefore this constructor call will not compile.          \n\nAlso a stylistic point:\n\nline 3: does not follow the JavaDoc convention of starting with /** (although starting with /* will not produce a syntax error).\n

There are two cases, q3 and q4.\n\n       Week3Quiz q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0);\n       Week3Quiz q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10);\n\nFor q3 the compiler will throw an error since no constructor exists for Week3Quiz(double, double). A double value cannot be assigned to an integer because of the potential loss of information.\n\nFor q4 the compiler will throw a different error. An integer value can be assigned to a double (with implicit type conversion) but in this case either of the defined constructors could be used, so the error is one of ambiguity.\n

Hello Java class,\n\nI am enjoying this course. The use of a 'grader' program is very ambitious!\nBut it must introduce some problems as there are too many solutions. Here\nis my method for the quadratic equation and the errors I got from the 'grader':\n\n\n        IO.output("Enter a: ");\n        double a = IO.input ....;\n        IO.output("...");\n        double b = ...;\n        IO.output("...");\n        double c = ...;\n        double b_sqr = ...;\n        double inner_sum = ...;\n        double inner_sum_abs = ...;\n        double inner_sum_sqrt = Math.sqrt(...);\n        double first_x = ...;\n        double second_x = ...;\n        IO.outputln("First solution for x = " + first_x + ",");\n        IO.outputln("Second solution for x = " + second_x + ",");\n*******************\n    The format of solution output lines is incorrect. Your output value might mix up other text. The solutions might be shown on the same line.\n\n    The solutions cannot be found without proper format.\n**************************************************\nFeel free to delete this if it gives too much away to other classmates!\nI have three questions:\n\n1) as you can see I have gotten lazy with my programming because this is a course and I am not writing code to be released in a commercial product. I put many statements in so that I can use the debugger and step through the program and watch - I never did this before, I always wrote code very carefully and never used a debugger! I also just went ahead and used double for everything, even though this uses more memory and is inefficient. It doesn't mind fetching an int and storing it in a double. The problem with this lazy approach is there are too many digits, far exceeding the number of significant digits of the inputs. How do you handle this issue?\n\n2) The instructions clearly show a comma (",") after each solution in the output format. Does the 'grader' know this??\n\n3) It was not entirely clear how much error checking was expected on the inputs - I used inputInterger as the only error checking really, so that the user (or the 'grader') could easily put in troublesome input values. How much are we expected to error check the inputs at this point in the course?\n\n\n----------\n***Edited by TAC***\n\n[***\[OFFICIAL\] Discussion Guidelines***][1]\n\nit keeps the original code [IMG]\n\n![enter image description here][]\n\n\n [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14526299878156433.png\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/558a5d7cb30d848ec4000767\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14526299878156433.png

This education.\nIt's not a machine human interaction, but a human-human one. Would be the same as not knowing why somebody explains you something but you do know what he is saying and if you collaborate you know what he or she is going to do (usually because the person tells you ahead of time, and promises for example to pay salary if you make this or this module). If you don't collaborate you either part ways and don't know eachother any longer from that point on or he/she does things you didn't exprect them to do. Everything really.\nEven science all the way to the Big Bang.

I suspect the problem doesn't come from the line of code "IO.output(...)". One way of finding out the source of error is to repeatedly comment out sections of the code to see if we can compile the code successfully. To comment out sections of your code, you can use the following syntax (Module 03 content):\n\n>     /*\n>     \n>     The code between /* and */  are commented and is not executed by Java.\n>     \n>     */\n\n:)

I think that it isn't  a well defined problem because you can interpret it in many different ways for example, you could think of ways that don't even exist yet for travel to London like a wormhole .because of this there is not a finite amount of steps to be taken because the question is so broad the solutions could be infinite depending on how many factors are not given in this problem and the lack of restraints that are not set in place.

thank you... i think i just got a little sloppy with my syntax on the discussion board here, but i get what you are saying.\n\nthanks!
568f5807a66778054d000195
Usually, we declare a variable size to hold the array length when we need to length of the array for multiple times in the program to avoid typing long expressions like "scoreArray.length at every location".\n\nIn this program the variable, size,  could be used in the condition part of the for loop, but it is also fine to just type "scoreArray.length" since we are only referring it at one location. So you can either code:\n\n>     for ( int i = 0; i < scoreArray.length; i++ ) {\n>         IO.output ("Enter score for student " + i + ":");\n>         scoreArray [i] = IO.inputDouble ( );\n>     }\n\nOR\n\n>     int size = scoreArray.length;\n>     \n>     for ( int i = 0; i < size; i++ ) {\n>         IO.output ("Enter score for student " + i + ":");\n>         scoreArray [i] = IO.inputDouble ( );\n>     }\n\nAnd, just a kind correction that **scoreArray** is a single identifier, so it is not **score.Array**. Also the initialization part, the condition part and the update part of the for loop should be separated by a semicolon, but not a comma.\n\n:)

559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
A typical household and its appliances come to mind about abstraction. We know open a door lock the door should open, when you try to punch or squeeze the wall it will not because of the way it is constructed or the materials used (cement, wood, ceramic..). \n

What are the criterea defining "the best way"? is it cost? travel duration? low risk? etc? 
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
yup\n
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
no as there are many ways of travelling from hong kong to London\n

I'll use a calculator as an example of abstraction in daily life. We input the mathematical data to be solved into the calculator's keypad, and press the equation symbol "=" however we do not think of how the calculator is able to solve the problem. Yet, we come to the conclusion if we have properly input the equation to be solved, we will receive an accurate answer.

Abstraction reminds me of when I first bought a PC years ago. We had to use DOS then. Now we have windows and everything loads automatically and we have a graphical user interface that even a child can use all by herself. At that time, I heard that even DOS (which was rather complicated to learn at first), was an abstraction of the ultimate machine language where the hardware only understands on or off.\n\nWhen I first bought my handphone in 1984, I had a lot of problems with cheaper models and ended buying the Motorola then for 3 grands. It was easy to make a call but I knew how complicated it was to actually relay those signals through complicated hardware as well as software just to talk so conveniently ANYWHERE which gave new mobility and efficiency to me.\n\nYet such technology is so much more affordable now, with touch screens etc, and it has become an indispensible part of our daily lives.\n\nTechnology is always improving, though these are transparent to us because of abstraction.

By definition using the word 'best' makes the statement almost entirely subjective. By 'best' do they mean the fastest flight? Or maybe the most comfortable or the one with the fewest layovers. Personally, I can't get a cheap flight without it having at least one layover, so I prefer that layover to be over an hour long because it means if my first flight is delayed, I'm less likely to miss the second flight. That's my 'best'. So we can't adequately answer the question regarding travel from Hong Kong to London without understanding the variables which matter most to the individual asking the question. \n\nSecond to that is the point made that there is more than one city called London. We automatically assume which they mean because one stands above the rest and is more commonly known, but, for example, there is a London, Oregon near where I live. I might make the mistake of thinking of that city first. Comparatively, my friend lives near London, Ontario. Say I was flying to meet with my friend, and needed to make sure I got the right London, the less common choice.

As much as I would like to say that just saying "the best way" is simply vague, there are solutions to this defined problem and it is more than likely that only the best is to be picked.

An app providing Cab Service is also a good example of it. As we are not concerned about the cars used by the service provider or how the app was programmed or how the whole system works. But rather we just call a cab using it and pay using our card or cash.\nAnd also each part is separated from each other and yet connected. Like the UI of that app will not affect the service, the changing of drivers will not effect the overall system and so on.\nSo every part is separated and yet they all together are working as whole to give user a good service.

First line of code in main contains 2 errors. 'IO-output' is not valid. If you want something printed then either you should use System.out.println(), or with the package of this course IO.output(). Also, the statement should be ended with a semicolon, not a comma.\nI also see some type conversion issues, but I'll leave that to the rest.

Navigation System in car's is good example too I guess. We are focused on the instructions, map .. (output) and nobody know's what is going on underneath the device. We have many more examples nowadays such as digital watches, Vignette buying systems (aparats on petrol stations), Digital Camera, etc

Hi Aliya-Khan,\n\nthe Final Exam has not a clock counting the time you have spent on it ( for your knowledge, you must know that it is designed to be complete in 2-6 hours ), so you can continue finishing Modules 4 and 5 and lastly complete the Final Exam. Good luck. :)
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
For graded problem sets, you should see the answers after you have answered correctly or have used up all submissions. For labs, the answers are usually released after the due date. :)
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
Hi Ansel_Rover,\n\nThe course end date is now extended to late March. You can continue to try on different exercises and receive feedback from the code grading problems. Should you have any other doubts, please don't hesitate on letting us know through the discussion forum.\n\n:)
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
They are updated now. :)

Hi LittleSailorGirl,\n\nSubmissions to the labs and graded exercises should be available now. Please try again. :)
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
Hi Ada_Doix,\n\nActually, there is no timer associated with this exam. That means you can finish it in two separate time slots if it fits your schedule better. The exam is indeed designed to be finished in 2 hours. :)
5683bafe08ea03f244000555
Yes. The deadline of the course is extended now and you should be able to upgrade to the Verified Certificate later. :)
5680ca677febe56c59000492
According with your comment, i assume you could  complete the task successfully. :)
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
I am very excited that the course deadline is going to be extended!  As I just started this course a few days ago this will give me a chance to complete this course and then move on to the next course you are offering!  I am hoping that you are in the process of updating the coursework due dates so that we can continue to submit that work. Thanks again!
5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd
If the due date has been extended, it would be great if the coursework due dates were updated as well as we can't submit since the deadline that was previously set, was set for today.  
5680ca677febe56c59000492
I did the same in the two previous exercises "Angle of a triangle" and "Multiplication" that have the same instruction.

Hi. I had a very late start to the course and I don't think I'm going to be able to finish by the grading deadline. I intend to participate in the Java 2 course available through edX starting January 15th, but to do so would require me to complete the coursework in this course which I haven't, yet. I see that the submission buttons will be disabled after the 30th. Is there any way for me to get feedback on late assignments and/or issues while I'm working on them?\n\nI do understand that I won't be getting credit for this course under any circumstance.\n\nThanks for everything.

Is there a possibility to do this exam in two phases? Due to the reminder of the deadline tomorrow I am trying to do this exam but I find Final Exam Question a bit too difficult so getting this exam done within time is not possible. I do know that knowledge of arrays are required here but the difference in knowledge level between the course itself and this exam is a bit too much in my humble opinion. A maximum of 6 hours is given, but in 90 minutes I reached this Final Exam Question but I am still struggling ( 00:30 in the morning and need to go up early).\nAre there any possibilities or should I consider this course a total disaster for me?\n\nThanks in advance for reaction and kind regards,\n\nAad ~ Doix

The keyboard that I am using to type this response. The keys are labeled to enhance usability.  The keys when pressed are a simple mechanical switch (on/off). The switch then relays the signal to a processor. In object oriented programming the key is an object of the keyboard class, the label (letter, number or symbol) is an attribute of that object.  The function of key being pressed then relaying to the screen is the object's method. Abstraction is being blissfully unaware of the key's method until you take a key off to see how it works (which I just did).

hi BestAdventure\n\n***About your first post***\n\n>    Hello All, I am beginning to work on Lab 2 and want to verify if I need to account for certain situations.\n>     \n>    For the first task: **Multiplying 2 integers**.\n>     \n>   * What if the user inputs something other than an integer (i.e. letter, decimal?)\n\nYou must assume the gradder is evaluating your code by introducing as **"user inputs" only integers** numbers. So in your code you don't have to write **exceptions** or use some **methods from Scanner.class** to verify other user inputs as decimal numbers or characters ( that will crash the code). **The code, you have to write, has to expect only integers as user inputs.**\n\n\n    \n\n> * Also do I need to consider the fact that the Primitive Int is restricted -2^31 to 2^31-1? What if the user enters something outside\n> that range?\n\nAbout this question, **the code will not crash but could be it don't give the correct answer** if the entered values are really big integers.

Well ignoring syntax, the result would end up being 20.0 on the first one and 0 on the second.\nOn the first one its double so the answers have decimal and on the second answer was made from integers.

Will this course(part 1) start again after the 30th December deadline? Or will we have to just start part 2? I just enrolled today and 30th december is impossible for me. So, when will the part 1 re-start again?

Ok--Not sure how often the discussions are being monitored since it is the Holidays and this is at the beginning of the course and the course is almost over---\n\nI tried my code with numbers that should work and it did just fine\nA character (letter) crashed the program---I guess that is ok for this program--although I would want to gently tell my user that they had entered an invalid entry and to try again if this were developed for a real user\n\nDecided I would avoid the int problem and just go with Long.  Although it is certainly possible to go outside those ranges---it isn't very probable--so I am ok with it.\n\nTriangle program has the same issues with an additional problem.  If the user puts in a negative value the calculation still takes place and reports a negative area.  \n\nI know that we need to validate the user input for acceptable values and am hoping that we will be learning how to do that.\n\nIf anyone is monitoring this discussion and I am way off base, please let me know.\n\nThanks!

Since the course is designed to be finished in 5 weeks, it would not be easy to complete all the materials before the assessment deadline if you do not have any programming background.\n\nNevertheless, you are still encouraged to go through the course materials to learn Java programming language and problem solving skills. Although the submission buttons will be disabled after the deadline, the course materials will still be available for a short period of time (around 1 - 2 weeks) .\n\nPlease let us know if you have any other problems regarding the course. :)

Is this also for someone starting the course late? \n\nI only enrolled a few days ago and having this all done by the 30th is a little ambitious with the holiday looming.

Yes, is not really basic level, but if you passed it, then it means that you have learnt a lot... you could try also those two courses, they are self-paced also, to consolidate your skills until HKUST re-opens the part 2.

Hi Elbert,\n\nWelcome to the course!\n\nSince this course is designed to be completed in 5 weeks time, it would be quite difficult to finish the course materials and assessments in just 10 days and achieving a passing mark for the certificate. However, I would still recommend you to study the course materials in order to learn problem solving and the Java programming language through interesting examples.\n\nShould you have any doubt on the course materials, please let us know through the discussion forum. :)

Hi GeraldO-A,\n\nAs Ricardo mentioned, for all submission exercises of this course, **only the score of the last submission will be counted**.\n\nSince the answer to the question has already been shown after all submissions are used, it would be technical difficult for us to reset the submissions.\n\nHowever, please don't be discouraged as there are still many interesting problems in the rest of this course. The important thing is that you learn from the problem and understand what went wrong so that you will not make the same mistake again. :)

Hi eechonghan\n\nI don´t really get you, because you are mixed both terms constructors ( to initialize objects and its instance variables ) and methods....\n\nto reduce the numbers of constructors, (**01**) you could **extend** super classes\nand also (**02**) design methods with modifier "**static**", so you do not need to create an object ( via constructor ) to invoke that static method\n\n    \n\n> Math.sqrt( ? );\n\n\nanother concept than you maybe want to know is the implementation of **interfaces** ( but this is not covered in this course ) and avoid to re-write the same code for different classes,... revise [***this***][1]\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/5654686bc415f3d4d50002dd

Hi RicardoAbian,\nThanks for the above pointers.\n\nRegarding constructors, I was similarly wondering whether the number of constructors can be reduced. \n\nFor example in VB, to calculate a square root, I could write:\n\n    \n\n> Function squareRoot(number as double, optional methodToUse="Newton")\n> as double\n\nJava would require two constructors for the above.

An argument mismatch error would occur when you try to compile it.  The compiler knows that the instance parameters don't match the declared constructors so it throws an error.

A coffee maker. We know that when we put water in the container and add the grounded beans in, with the filter, we expect to have a warm beverage after a few minutes we press the 'ON' button. The design of the coffee machine has some parameters, but after meeting the minimum requirements coffee makers can come in all shapes,colors, and sizes.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I believe that the question "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is a well-defined problem because all solutions will lead to the end result. The word "best" is a relative term and since we live in a world that is based on our relative perception of reality one person may think that their solution is correct while another may not. We cannot always agree on the answer, however, we can agree that there are multiple methods to achieve the end result, and this is what matters. A well-defined problem is one that has a question which can be thought about and solved to achieve the outcome, even though the outcome may not always be best it is still a solution. We can always exam all the possible solutions and find an optimal solution by examining the best parts of each answer.

559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
actually the given constructor was not matching with the parameters(10.0,10.0!=int,double &  10,10!=double,int) \ntherfore the compiler will automatically displays an error message as  no suitable constructor is found/argument mismatch/given constructor is not aplicable.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The program would fail to compile as a suitable constructor could not be found.

Well-defined problems need to be constrained on what are "the rules" for it, so that any person who's going to answer the problem get to the same answer, in my opinion. So, in the way this problem is written, it is not a well defined problem, there are a lot of loose ends (What is "the best way"? Does it depend on the transportation? Time duration? Comfort?)

Hi John\n\nnormally we use the term "**default constructor**" to name a constructor with **no arguments**.\n\nyou could visit this document:\n\n*Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. Providing Constructors for Your Classes*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html\n\n\n    \n\n> The compiler automatically provides a no-argument, **default constructor**\n> for any class without constructors.\n\n\n... in this case, in ColorImage.class the **default constructor** is this one:\n\n*Class ColorImage*\n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/ColorImage.html\n\n\n>    public **ColorImage()**\n>\n>    Constructs a ColorImage object by **loading an image from the file system** and re-scales it to fit the default canvas size.

Dear Leo and Ricardo,  I have amended my codes and added "private int type;" in the following position. There is no compilation error but it returns 0 no matter what choices I put.  I am pretty sure my if-else coding was correct.  Are there any reasons that the type variable cannot be changed? Thanks.\n\nPublic class Lab04GradedTask1\n{\n   private int type;\n   \n   public int compareWith(Choice anotherChoice) {\n\n   ...\n\n\n   }\n\n\n}

Hi eechonghan\n\n**i )** let us know what are you trying to looking for about constructors... [ revise also the "Activity" about constructors ]\n\n**ii )** ... about redesigning the Color Image methods, because the class is not open source... it could be implemented in this way by using the methods available, for instance:\n\n    public void changeRBGvalues ( int red , int green , int blue ) {\n        if ( red >= 0 ) { increaseRed( red ); }\n            else { decreaseRed( red ); } \n        if ( green >= 0 ) { increaseGreen( green ); }\n            else { decreaseGreen( green ); }  \n        if ( blue >= 0 ) { increaseBlue( blue ); } \n            else { decreaseBlue( blue ); }\n    }\n\n**iii )** if you want to improve your knowledge about ColorImage.class, you will have to start learning the java library provided:\n\n\n> java.awt.Graphics\n\n*Class Graphics*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html\n\n*Class Color*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/Color.html\n\n*Oracle.

Lesson: Getting Started with Graphics*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/2d/basic2d/\n\nbasically the concept is traverse the whole image object ( line by line ) by reading every pixel, and then get its color ( RGB ) and increase or decrease its values.

Hi RicardoAbian.\nJust adding a little bit more to the above. \nThanks for the link to the constructors. While not exactly what I was looking for, using the "this" keyword in the constructors section makes the coding neater and I'm inclined to use this coding style in future. Thanks.
566bfbefd782e5c1ad0001bc
Hi RicardoAbian.\nThanks for your response.\n1. You are correct. The methods belongs to the ColorImage class - not the Canvas class.\n2. If I understand you correctly, it is possible to "re-design" the class by combining similar methods - please correct me if I'm wrong.\n3. nuno_hc_mendes' experiment with A.jpg+increaseRed(int x) is very interesting.  Never thought of that. Thanks.

Hello John,\n\nPlease tell us which line of code BlueJ is highlighting when the error **"cannot find symbol -variable type"** comes out.\n\nAs Ricardo mentioned, the private instance variable **type** should already been declared in the **Choice** class. We should be able to access it by the expression **"this.type"** inside the methods of the **Choice** class.\n\nPlease also try to make sure if:\n\n1. you are working on the method **"public int compareWith(Choice anotherChoice)" { ... } "** inside the Choice class.\n\n2. the statement **"private int type;"** at the top of the Choice class is not accidentally removed.\n\nLet us know if the problem can be resolved. :)
566d8b7308f9a5f513000237
Hello Tommy,\n\nYour code is fine and we have recorded you passing this task (Lab 02 Graded Task 1).\n\nAs Ricardo said, it would not be necessary to use the **Integer**  wrapper class for declaring an integer variable. We could use the **int** primitive data type instead to make the program more efficient.\n\nTo explain in details, since the "IO. ..." method is return a primitive data type value, Java will have to do a automatic conversion of this value to its wrapper class type (i.e. from **int** to **Integer**) before assigning it to the wrapper class variable. This process of automatic conversion from primitive data type to its wrapper class type is know as **autoboxing** in Java. The reverse process is know as **unboxing**.\n\nYou can learning more about autoboxing and unboxing in the following link:\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/autoboxing.html\n

@mrreddy6 -  \ncompiler would generate a default constructor only if no other constructors are defined explicitly by the programmer. in his case since already parameterised constructors have been declared we have to define a default constructor explicitly, the compiler wouldn't create one!!

**ArrayList + Enhanced For-Loop . intro**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nLet me introduce another class in Java, in this part we are working with **Arrays.class**, but it has some limitations,... like it is always **fixed**.\n\nSo at this point would be interesting to introduce "**collections**" in java,... because we can increase the numbers of array's elements and any kind of objets ( from same class or by using interfaces any objects that implements that interface ( interfaces are not covered in this part1 ) ).\n\n***Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. Lesson: Introduction to Collections***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/intro/index.html\n\n    \n\n> A collection — sometimes called a container — is simply an object that\n> groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections are used to\n> store, retrieve, manipulate, and communicate aggregate data.\n\n***Oracle. The Java™ Tutorials. The List Interface***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/list.html\n\n    \n\n> A List is an ordered Collection (sometimes called a sequence). Lists\n> may contain duplicate elements. In addition to the operations\n> inherited from Collection, the List interface includes operations for\n> the following:\n> \n> 1. **Positional access** — manipulates elements based on their numerical position in the list. This includes methods such as get, set, add,\n> addAll, and remove.\n\n >2. **Search** — searches for a specified object in the list and returns its numerical position.

hi Nick\n\nthe game presents a small bug that could be easily implemented....\n\n*that is pick up the same card twice... or more times*\n\n***[e.g ]** .. define a new array with boolean values and verify it at any time, if a card was facing up before  then does not allow to select it again...*\n\n\nbut it is supposed that someone playing a "solitaire" game, does not want to lie her/himself **:)**\n\n\nI cannot manage where is your error without viewing your code, but in BlueJ your code has to work properly without picking up the same card several times...\n\nthe only thing I can say is revise your outside loop and your inner loop/s, I **suppose** your code is written with that syntax structure...\n\n... basically you have to do three things to complete this exercise......\n\ncould you let us know which **pseudocode** are you designing ( an abstract scheme is enough ) ?\n\nlIke:\n\n>     set up a ...\n>     then I ... ... by...\n>     ....

Hello Folks,\n\nI am Prahlad Yeri, a Freelance Web Developer from Ahmedabad, India. A bit late to the party as I see that the submission is due on 30th December. Nevertheless, I hope to fast-track most of the basic stuff since I know a lot of Java SE already. I've joined this course to get a basic Java refresher, and more importantly, evaluate edX.org as a MOOC platform. So far, so good!\n\nThanks\nhttps://www.prahladyeri.com

If we consider the Traveling salesman problem or other algorithms, it is usually the DISTANCE traveled that needs to be optimized. So, an assumption could be made that the problem is asking to find the nearest areal route between Hong Kong and London. But of course, that doesn't make the problem "well defined".

No, it is not as the exact destination is not provided. Plus the "best way' is defined differently for different people like some people prefer cheap options other might prefer fast options or most comfortable option etc.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I don't believe that it's a well defined problem simply because "best way" is subjective. Perhaps to you the "best way" means the best value. Perhaps to a man named Jacob the "best way" means the most luxurious of trips. Then, perhaps to me, "best way" means that it's the least expensive and fastest.\n\nThe variables are not defined in this problem.

Have you ever been to a Wawa convenience store in the US Northeast? They have all these self-serve touch screens with menu options everywhere. You just touch the food image on the screen that you want, custumize it how you want, and BOOM  it is there to pick up a few minutes later.Most of the time when you are eating that garbage low quality fast food it is late night (many times a bit inebriated) and you and your friends could care less how the kitchen got the message of what to make, who is making it or how they are making it. You just press the button, and BOOM! you get your sandwich at the counter a few minutes later. feels like a stimulus response situation, when in reality there is a lot of electrical, programing and human processes going on behind that curtain.

566624c888f756dd3c000326
Thanks a lot!... Now it is working. So, if anyone has the same problem as mine, just write on the top of the program "import comp102x.IO;"
5665cdab88f7569109000310
it meansr current choice will be  either 1 or 2 and i have to frame the code accordingly... 
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
My immediate thought was a Switch Board. We just know which switch is connected to which object but the circuit that's going on inside is not visible to us nor do we need to know about it.
566624c888f756dd3c000326
To use the IO class properly in your own projects, you will need to copy the "**+libs**" folder to the BlueJ project folder and add an import statement "**import comp102x.IO;**" at the beginning of the program.\n\nYou can refer to the following thread for the details:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/559fda21b30d8499560014db\n\nHowever, if you just want to compile the CourseGrade program, you can download it directly from the Week 2 section of the [Resources page][1]. This CourseGrade program has been tested and should compile fine. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/f792f3a2057040aa959e606d687e9bc4/

Hi klmkl,\n\nPerhaps as an additional comment, you should also be careful about the Lab task you are attempting. From the error message you posted, it is likely that you are attempting the **second** task of Lab 02 instead of the first task.\n\nPlease let us know if you have further doubts. :)

Sir.. I couldn't figure out how to solve the NullPointerException problem becasue it is not  coming from the source I wrote but rather from the source already written in the testCase. So I decided to test the makeChoice method by creating a object of the computer class and and it worked for the given range that is 0-2 but I was shocked when I submitted the snippet and got thie error\n\nincorrect\nCompilation Test: Passed.\nNumber of Test Case Groups Passed: 0/2\n\n    Incorrect. The value represented by the Choice instance is not in the valid range which is from 0 to 2.\n    Incorrect. The randomness of value represented by the Choice instance cannot be tested when they are not in the valid range.

in the case of q3(10.0, 10.0) : A double literal can't be assigned to a variable of type integer without an explicit cast. So in this case java machine complains because the parameters provided does't match the arguments of any constructor.\nin the case of q4(10, 10) : An integer literal can be assigned to a variable of type double without an explicit cast.

**Code Segment 01:**   The array int[] a has not been initialized.  Hence, when we run the program we will get an error message.\n\n**Code Segment 02**:  The output will be 3234.  As int[] b has been been assigned the int[] a, any change in  b will be reflected in array a.  Hence, a[0] and a[1] will change to 3 and 2 from 1 and 2.\n\n**Code Segment 03:** The line  int() a = new int(20) should be re-written to indicate an array i.e., int[] a new int[20].  If this is done, the output will be "Zero".\n\n**Code Segment 04:** The output sought is only the values of i used in the iteration and not the values of the array.  Hence the output will be 0123;\n\n**Code Segment 05:**  The line int[] a = {1.5, 2.5, 3.5}; declares an int array, but initializes it to double values. Hence, there will be an error.  If this is rectified by changing the type of the array from int to double, the answer will be 2.5.  As the final output avg also requires a double, correcting int into double should be fine.

\n\n**Using "this" with a Constructor**\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\n>    From within a constructor, you can also use the this keyword to call another constructor in the same class. Doing so is called an\n>**explicit constructor invocation**.

hi GauravRanjan\n\n**01)** I suppose your question is about  : **MODULE 03 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 3A**\n\nif so, if the gradder's message is :\n\n>     Compilation Error(s):\n>     [ERROR] cannot find symbol, symbol: variable dist, location: class Car2Task1.\n\n\n.. it means that the variable "**dist**" passed as an argument in the method **is not declared in the gradder**, so **you cannot use it into your code** ( avoid to use "dist" into the TASK 3A, you will use it later to complete TASK 3B )\n\nFor TASK 3A,  you **ONLY** need to write a line_code to : "**declare the double variable rotationInRadians and assign an appropriate value to it**" [ Please re-read the instructions provided carefully ]\n\n\n>public void moveForward ( int dist )  {\n>     \n>    int rotationInDegrees = carImage.getRotation();\n>     \n>    // Please write your code after this line\n>\n>    // **Declare the double variable "rotationInRadians"**\n>\n>    //  **and assign an appropriate value to it.**\n>     \n>     }\n\n\n\nHope was helpful, let us know any other matters....\n\n**02)** ... for **TASK 3B**, then you can use the variable "**dist**" passed as an argument by the method,... ( the gradder in TASK 3B recognizes it )\n\nand the new variables you have to declare and initialize are called : "**distX**" and "**distY**". ( remember the last letter must be in **uppercase** )\n

For the first case \nWeek3Quiz q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0); it will show an error, As both the parameter are double type and none of the constructor can support it. Q3 will not work.\n\nFor the second one \n Week3Quiz q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10);\nit may work as both the parameter are integer type and a double can easily handle integer limits.\nfor Q4 the answer will be 0.

hi  Anastasia\n\naccording with the API, the method "**outputln(..)**" has a Modifier : "static" and Type : "void"\n\n"**static**" means that can be invoked directly without creating an object previously from IO.class. As example :\n\n    \n\n> IO.outputln("Hello");\n\n\n\n"**void**" means that the method does not return a value. [ used, for example, to set instance variable values ], **in this case this method typed as "void" is used to print something on the terminal and jumps to a new line.**\n\n\n\n\n\n>     static void	         outputln(java.lang.Object value)\n>     Prints a value on the terminal and jumps to a new line.\n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/IO.html\n\n\nin your code, please revise this :\n\n>      revise this "int" before the method invocation   \n>      v\n>\n> **int** IO.outputln("7*3 equals " + calculated_result);\n\n\nalso, please **check your code firstly in BlueJ before submitting** your answer in the gradder ( **the task 1 is to implement a general method to get any two user inputs ( integers ) and prints on terminal the multiplication result** )\n\n\nlet us know further doubts\n\n:)

I think this is not well-designed question. We only have part of information to achieve the result. You have to ask to yourself What means the best way? We know we have to go from A to B but we don't have enough information to deduce which is "the best way"

in line 10 the name of the variable Celsius is wrong, it should be lower case celsius. in line 12 (not 13) the name of the variable fahranheit is incorrect, it must be fahrenheit, there is not an instruction such IO.outputln, it must be IO.output.
559a2cc6a9a36edf340010b2
I agree with Anujfalcon, 9/5 will give an integer with no decimal part.
559a2cc6a9a36edf340010b2
**Error 1**\n\nLine number: 6\n\nDescription of bug: the instruction IO-input; the apostrophes inside the parentheses; the line ends with a coma.\n\nSuggested fix: replace IO-input with IO.input, use quotation marks instead of apostrophes inside the parentheses and end the line with a semicolon.\n\n**Error 2**\n\nLine number: 10\n\nDescription of bug: the variable Celsius, the integer division 9/5.\n\nSuggested fix:  Celsius must be written celsius, in the division one or the two integers must be written with .0, I mean 9.0 and/or 5.0 otherwise the result will be truncated.\n\n**Error 3**\n\nLine number: 12\n\nDescription of bug: The instruction IO.outputln, the variable fahranheit, the line doesn't end with a semicolon.\n\nSuggested fix:  replace IO.outputln with IO.output, replace fahranheit with fahrenheit, end the line with a semicolon.
56609b1c4ed749f8a3000142
Yes, you are correct that abstraction can be applied in different levels to form a hierarchy.\n\nTaking a combat game as an example, the game play designer will just need to know what characters will there be and what moves they can perform. How are the characters being modeled and animated are not the main concerns of the game play designer.\n\nThe 3D model designer, on the other hand, will only need to focus on creating the character models and the associated animations according to the graphics designer's specification. He or she doesn't need to know how the graphics designer came up with the characters in the first place.\n\n:)

You are correct that the concept of multiplication should be represented by "*" instead of "x" when we talk about **arithmetic expressions** in Java. In slide 13, we are just referring to the general concept of multiplication, so we simply use "x". :)

to further explain what **coachaz** said, dont look at the name being supplied as argument in a method call, rather look at the ordering.\nb=s.two(a,b) a= 4, b=5 => b=s.two(4,5)\nbut c = one (b, a) => c = one(5,4)  because the order was reverse from (a,b) in s.two to (b,a) in c=one().

**@eechonghan & Esbee51:** c is never a local are pointed out by **Esbee51**. c is an instant variable. **@eechonghan:** your answers are right but labelling c as local is wrong.

**Rounding floating-point numbers to a specific decimal place after evaluating the next one. Method**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nHere I leave you a method to truncate a floating-point numbers to a specific decimal place given, \nalso the method will evaluate the next decimal place to round the result according with that digit, \nif the next digit is in range [0-4], then the method just truncates the specified decimal part, \nbut if it is in range [5-9], the method will is rounding up the result with one decimal at the decimal part truncated.\n\n\nThis method cannot be found in Math.class, so it will be interesting to know the

I want to disagree with the comment above on line 25 & 29. cleanSlateProtocol() is just outputing strings on the standard output while setID() does only change the state of the instance variable ID. Only getID() would require a return type.

Please see your statement against line 4 last column, first sentence.  You are clling c as a local variable.  In 4  lines below that you are accepting c as instance variable.  Is it because, the method two was called as s.two   and the method one was called only by method two and not by the object s ( s.one) ? Please clarify.\n

According to me, the output will be as follows:\nOne: 7,5,10\nTwo: 4,5,5\nMain: 5,4,5\n\nMost of the people in this forum have already given the same answer, much much before me. I thank all of them.  Yet, I venture to repeat the answers along with my thought pattern in arriving at the solution to know whether my answers are matching with those of others through right thinking or by chance.\n\nI have arrived at the soluction based on the following logic.\n\nThe program starts from the 'main' function, as it is the entry point. The execution will be as per the code inside this 'main' function.\n\nThe first statement creates a an object 's' using the default constructor as no constructor has been defined inside  the program code.\n\nThe next two statements create local variables 'a' and 'b' and initializes them to values 4 and 5.\n\nThe next line seeks to change the value of the local variable 'b' by assigning the value of  s.two (a, b).\nHere, 's' is the new object created in statement 1 of the main method. two(a,b) is the method two declared as :\npublic int two (int a, int b).   The point to be decided here is which values of 'a' and 'b' have to be passed into this method.  Only two instance variables have been declared viz., 'c' and 'a'.  As no 'b' is there as an instance variable, the doubt is only about 'a'.   In my opinion, in the absence of 'this' reference, the value will be that of the local variable of the 'main' function.  Thus, the values 4 and 5 for a and b will be passed on to method 'two'.\n\nMethod 'two' seeks to arrive at the value of 'c' as equal to 'one (b, a)'. The value of the local variables for the method 'one' will therefore be:   a=5 and b=4 as the values of the 'main' method are passed on as 'b,a' for int a and int b for the method 'one'.\n\nUnder method 'one', the values of 'c' , 'a' and 'b' can be arrived at as 10,7 and 5 respectively.  As the output statement presents these values in the order 'a', 'b' and 'c', the output will read as 7,5,10.\nThe value to be returned from this method is that of 'b' and therefore it will be 5.   As method 'one' was called by method ;two; to arrive at the value of its  variable 'c', the value of 'c' will be 5.\n\nThe value of instance variable 'c' ,which was originally initialized as 1, became 10 under method 'one' and now it has been changed to 5 under method two.\n\nUnder method 'two', the value of  instance variable 'a' is changed from 1 (original declaration) by using the 'this' keyword. This value is arrived at by adding 1 to the value of local variable 'a', which is 4.  Thus, value of instance variable becomes 5 ( 4+1).\n\nHowever, the IO.output statement only wants the value of local variable 'a' , it is not qualified as this.a.  The output will therefore be:  4,5,5.\n\nMethod 'two' returns the value of 'b' for the main method as : 5. \n\nThe main method's IO.output statements seek to print the values of  's.a', 'b' and 's.c'.  \n's.a' and 's.c' being reference to the instance variables 'a' and 'c' and 'b' refers to the local variable, the output will be 5,4,5.\n\nI have written in detail believing that someone will read this patiently and point out flaws, if any, in my thinking.

HI albertodejesus,\n\nActually, we don't need to use array or loops to complete this lab. The black and white tile pattern is actually an image and what we wish to complete in this lab is to load one or more images onto the canvas, perform some image arithmetic and position the images in the correct positions.\n\nIt is correct that in the underlying implementation, we are using loops and arrays, however, to complete the task, you will just need to make method calls and you are not required to know the underlying implementation. This is another example of abstraction where you just focus on what the methods can do rather than how the methods completes it.\n\n:)

The compiler will return an error because the parameters of the constructor calls are not matching any constructor declarations

Many have correctly identified most of the bugs .  I would like to add only one bug viz.,  Line 3: Comments should begin with "/" followed by two asterix.  Second asterix is missing.\n\nThough strictly not a bug, I also would like to mention that the method names dance() and  cleanSlateProtocol(), do not appear to satisfy the criteria that names of method should reflect the action they propose to carry out..

The program will return an error message.  The two objects being sought to be created using the new  keyword  viz., Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0) and  Week3Quiz(10, 10) do not satisfy the requirements of the two constructors Week3Quiz(int i, double d) and  Week3Quiz(double d, int i), as their parameters are different from those of the new objects i.e., they are not double & int or int & double.  The programs inability to match the parameters of the constructors will result in an error message.

But it wasn't a double, it was integer so I don't think it needed the decimal point? The value of the 10 doesn't change at least from the math aspect of it.\n

The obvious one here would be computers. We use computers for many different functions, but if one of the components break, then we only pay attention to how to get if fixed.

An instrument like a clarinet. We just  want to make the best sound through the instrument. At the same time, when it emits a squeak or creates a sound lacking richness and clarity, we usually question the reed rather than question how the clarinet works.

Wow.. since when the constructor is invoked using the new operator, the types MUST match those that are specified in the constructor definition; otherwise the compiler will not know which is correct (or right) constructor to call. Hence Java generates a Compilation error from no suitable constructor found for Week3Quiz(double,double) or Week3Quiz(int,int).

I found this one quite difficult, there are more errors than I initially expected, most of all of them already mentioned above. I still have a question about the value of id. This starts with a "?" but is then changed by an empty value, so when this piece of code is running well could it be that it still gives a wrong first sentence, namely Mark <space> in stead of Mark "?" ? Or am I wrong?\n\nKind regards,
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
As Java as programming language is very logical I would suppose that this piece of code should give errors. Given values do not match parameter types so why implicitely converting?\n\nKind regards,

 I don't think we had enough preparation for this assignment. I don't see how this program can be accomplished without the use of for loops and arrays. Also, we had no instruction on how to fill rectangles with a color. It was a big leap from a simple assignment finding roots of a quadratic equation to the lab3 assignment which involved drawing figures and coloring. Requires more information on the lectures.

To find the best way, you have to define what is understood with "best". Also it's necessary to know how one will be able to compare and afterwards choose what is best.

Hi Aad_Doix,\n\nActually, there are various barcode formats. The program given in this course only supports the EAN-13 format and therefore, inputting any other barcode format could result in an error.\n\nEAN-13 reference: http://www.barcodeisland.com/ean13.phtml\n\nThrough trying out this barcode program, you have just discovered an important concept in designing programs with input, that is, the **input format**. For example, if we are to design a program to accept a person's age as input, we should not be allowed to enter a letter (e.g. **w**). Entering a letter to such a program should cause the program to report an error.\n\nAs a following up discussion, could you think of any other considerations in additional to the **input format** when designing programs with inputs?\n\n:)
55d9da849714b0274300039e
I got the same error as described above. The program runs well when using files named like barcode1.jpg and barcode2.jpg. No other extentions are allowed as I thought, but an own scanned barcode saved as barcode.jpg (mention the lack of a number in the name) reproduces above mentioned error every time running the program.....\n\nKind regards,

hi ajeetpateel,\n\nWe have checked the records and could only find your submissions to the lab tasks and the exam. We have also tried to use our tester account for testing the submission to graded problems and it turns out to be working. Could you please try again to see if it is working now?\n\nPlease let us know the result. :)

hi puripuri,\n\nIf you are writing you own program, you may want to check the following points for resolving the IO expression problem:\n\n1. is there a "+libs" folder containing all the course libraries in the project?\n2. is there an import statement (import comp102x.IO;)  at the beginning of the program? reference\n3. are the methods that are invoked exist in the IO class?\n\nYou may also find the following post useful:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/559fda21b30d8499560014db\n\nplease let us know if the problem still exists after checking the above points\n\n:)\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/559fda21b30d8499560014db

I was thinking of my kindle fire.  I want all of my ebooks to be available whenever I want.  I don't necessarily need to know how or where they are stored, I just want access to read my book when I am ready.  Also, when I purchase a book, I just want it to show up in my carousel without having to manually download it, etc.  I don't need to know exactly how it got there, I just want to be available when I'm ready to read it.

This is absolutely not a "well defined question".  There are at lest 5 often used airports in London, and without clarifying which part of London the travelers are bounding for, there will be no "best way". Actually, there's no best answer to any kind of questions per se,  it depends from person to person. Nonetheless, you could have your own best answer to any kind of problems :)

I think it is no use to give some different examples. Apparently we have to understand that this phenomenon of DA is everywhere when human or even other creature uses the functionality of something and have controls to manage or control it. The question is what the kind and level of DA.. from the simpliest to the most complicated. This is awesome.
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e

564868d31dfe59261d000294
your first approach is ok, you must think about two questions:\n\n***1) revise :***\n\n    \n\n> ....setX(0);.................setY(0);..........................setRotation(0);\n\nyou are always setting up the position of the image using as parameter (0). Draw() method is giving you some parameters ( canvas, x, y, rotation ) to be used every time the method is invoked.\n\nGradder, as you can see, is testing your method implementation with three examples:\n\n>     .draw (canvas, 0, 0, 0);\n>     .draw (canvas, 16, 26, 90);\n>     .draw (canvas, -62, -76, 180);\n\nand your code always is doing ".draw (canvas, 0, 0, 0);", so positioning the image is always into the same position on canvas ( because you are not using the parameters passed with the draw() method as arguments)\n\n***2) revise :***\n\n    \n\n> canvas.add(....................,0,0);\n\nas i told you, by using this method, you are redefining the previously methods used ( setX(...) and .setY(...) )\n\ni will give you an example\n\ngiving this image (must be stored into the project's folder where tha class is located ):\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n..  and this code :\n\n>     import comp102x.*;\n>     public class Image {\n>         public static void main ( String[] args ) {\n>             Canvas canvas = new Canvas();\n>             ColorImage ci = new ColorImage("edx-logo.png");        \n>             ci.setX(100); ci.setY(100); ci.setRotation(90);\n>             canvas.add(ci,0,0);\n>             //canvas.add(ci);    \n>         }\n>     }\n\nthink what it will be shown using :   **canvas.add(ci,0,0);**  and then using **canvas.add(ci);**    ?\n\n***3) revise***\n\n... the documentation provided for these methods\n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/ColorImage.html\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/Canvas.html\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14479296504087426.png

Hi mohankp\n\nabout LAB 04 GRADED TASK 2 \n\nafter implementing "draw(Canvas canvas, int x, int y, int rotation)" method, you can se that 4 parameters are passed ( canvas , x , y & rotation ), these values are not fixed, because for your choice when "draw()" method is invoked the parameters passed are (canvas, 0, 480, 0), but for Computer's choice the parameters passed are (canvas, 0, 0, 180). Open the source codes in the project and search for draw() method.\n\nTo test your draw() method implementation you must add some code at  **Lab04GradedTask2** as given :\n\n>     Code in testCase1()\n>     \n>     Canvas canvas = new Canvas(480, 960);\n>     Choice choice1 = new Choice(0); //Rock\n>     choice1.draw(canvas, 0, 480, 0);\n\nother sample would be \n\n>     Code in testCase2()\n>     \n>     Canvas canvas = new Canvas(480, 960);\n>     Choice choice1 = new Choice(0); //Rock\n>     choice1.draw(canvas, 0, 0, 180);

thanks ricardo i got it.\nI have doubts in the same lab task with respect to the position of X Y and Rotation. are the values fixed at 0,480 and 0  OR can it be changed . If so where it is changed  whether in choice class or lab graded class. plz help

hi  BABLUUKUMAR\n\nthis is fine, while you are following this course, you will find some exercises where a source code is not available, this means that only is provided the "class" file and not the "java" file. So this is the message shown into the class's box in BJ.\n\n\nThe reason is explained is a lecture, it's because you must focus in some aspects of the exercise and not in the code itself.\n\n\nBut you can use that class ( with not source code or java file ) by right clicking with your mouse over it and create an object and run its methods ( or the main method if it is designed ).
56459b4790ef9aaee80001c1

I have an example of a car, where one gets in shoves the key, tilts and starts to drive it. We also have the radio user interface in the car, the knobs and switches for this and that. What we are in contact with mostly is not the turning pulleys of the drivebelt, the charging provided by the alternator, the brake pads, ball joints, sway bars etc, all that we do is to interact with the interface and we often change our rims, brakes, air intakes, engines transmissions and that won't affect how we interact with the car from inside the car. So that is one of the examples of abstraction.

Hola todos, falta definir exactamente que queremos saber, si cual es la forma más rápida de llegar o la más barata o la más cómoda, etc... hay varios puntos por considerar.
559a3085b30d8463fc0011d9
One: a =7, b=5, c=10\n\nTwo: a=4, b=5, c=5\n\nmain: s.a = 5, s.b =4, s.c=1
559a2cc6a9a36edf340010b2
[Error 1] Line number 2 : Description of bug :Class 'c' Should be in lowercase. It is in uppercase\n[Error 2] Line number 6 : Description of bug: IO-output is not valid. Suggested fix: should be replaced by IO.output\n[Error 3] Line number 6 : Description of bug: Enter degrees in Celsius is surrounded in the wrong marks. Suggested fix: Should be surrounded in " " and not ' '\n[Error 4] Line number 6 : Description of bug: , at the end of the row Suggested fix: needs to be substituted for ;\n[Error 5] Line number 10 : Description of bug: Celsius 'C' in uppercase Suggested fix: It should be in Lower case like 'celsius' \n[Error 6]\nLine number  12: Description of bug: "fahrenheit" is spelled incorrectly (spelled as fahranheit) and need a semicolon at the end of the statement. Suggested fix: Spelling should be like the variable declaration: fahrenheit and put a semicolon at the end of the statement.
559a2cc6a9a36edf340010b2
Error 1:\nLine 1\nletter c int he keyword Class is found to be in upper case\nclass is the suggested fix \nError 2:\nLine 4\nIO-output is not supported by java\nsystem.out.println("---");  is the suggested fix\nError 3:\nLine 4\nsyntax error\nThe content within the output statement should be enclosed within double quotes\nError 4:\nLine 4\nsyntax error\nthe statement should be terminated with semicolon(;)\nError 5:\nLine 7\nimproper usage of variable Fahrenheit\nthe usage of variable Fahranheit should be changed to Fahrenheit.\n\nThere are much more errors which are left to be debugged for others.\n\n

The errors are on:\n\nLine 17: It is a constructor, so it should not have a return type\n\nAnswer: The constructor must return any type even void.

559a2e6ab30d847c6f00104f
Line 42 !!!  There's no constructor suitable for a "no parameters" instance creation.\nProbably add a constructor that receives no parameters.\n

My first answer was: \n\nOne: 7, 5, 10\n\nTwo: 4, 5, 5\n\nMain: 5, 4, 1 -> I ignored that variable c was not declared in any method as local variable. So every method which use the variable c looks outside the method and find the variable s.c. My fault...\n\nA run with BlueJ show following output:\n\nOne: 7,5,10\n\nTwo: 4,5,5\n\nMain: 5,4,5\n

We would recommend you to choose the later version of Java, (i.e. Java 8). It should be fine if there is only one option for "javac". Please try to run the following commands to check if the "java" command and the "javac" command are working correctly:\n\n> java -version\n\n> javac -version\n\n:)

5635dc1cc7627771d200259d
Hi ankushgaurav,\n\nHere are some more suggestions:\n\n1. All variables you used should be declared inside the required method. Variables declared outside the method will not be recognized by the grader.\n\n2. Take an extra look at the feedback returned by the grader.\n\nShould you have further problems, please let us know. :)

I only saw 3 issues and one doubt:\n- line 6 IO-output should be IO.output, maybe even an other command, but I am not sure. \n- line 6 the comma at the end of line should be a dot-comma (';')\n- line 12 fahranheit never is declared, this should be fahrenheit to get any result from this piece of code.\n- I doubt about the Celsius on line 10 which is meant by celsius declared in line 8. As far as I thought reading in former chapter of this course, Java is case sensitive, so this will not work. Line 12 should contain lowercase celsius ....\n\nKind regards,

I agree. Here 'best' is an adjective, but everybody will put that adjective into real life problem in different ways. For example, for some people, best can mean cheap, for some people best can mean short duration, for others its affordable, or any specific medium like by road or by ship or by air considering the safety of each travel mode. Hence the problem here can have ambiguous solutions, hence it is not a well defined problem.

When you provide the user name and password and click on submit button..It will show Compose,Inbox,Outbox,Sentmails...so and so when you click on compose it will open...but user doesn't\nknow what are the actions performed internally....It just Opens....that is essential; User doesn't know internal actions ...that is non-essential things...

One good reason for placing the draw method in the Choice class is to allow loose coupling between the RockPaperScissors (RPS) class and the Choice class (i.e. the RPS class should have minimal knowledge on how methods related to the Choice class are implemented).\n\nIf the draw method is placed in the RPS class, the designer of the RPS class will need to know how to draw a Choice while this should really be the responsibility of the Choice class designer.\n\nPerhaps it might not make too much difference as we only have one class that requires drawing in this case. However, when we have more classes require drawing, the designer of the RPS class will need to know how to draw every of these classes and he/she will have to communicate with each of the designers of these classes.\n\nOne thing I often find useful when designing programs is to give myself different roles when working on different classes. It helped me on stop making assumptions on how other classes are implemented internally and thus making the classes less coupled. :)

Thanks leofan and RicardoAbian for your responses. I would definitely put work into these mentioned. <br>\n\n\n----------\n\n\nUsually in most  introductory courses that aspect of the solution is missing. In design sometimes what gets me stalling is deciding which class should own a feature. take for example the RockPaperScissors program, I was wondering why the draw method was placed in the Choice class and not with the RockPaperScissors class (thus taking in the Choice object as argument..?). Was there any special reason for this particular design?

Well, I have to say it is not always an easy task to model a problem into the appropriate classes and capturing the requirements precisely. Different problems behave differently. So a good way to learn modelling is by practicing more. Try to come up with a design on solving a particular problem and compare you design with others. List out the things you like and dislike on different designs will help you to come up with a better design approach.\n\nLearning design patterns is also another good way of improving your modelling skills. The following are some useful links on design patterns:\n\n - http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/\n   \n - http://www.oodesign.com/\n\n:)\n\n

Adds keylisteners\n        \n        addKeyListener(new AL()); \n        \n        setTitle("Java Game Rox");\n        setSize(800, 600);\n        setResizable(false);\n        setVisible(true);\n        setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\n        \n\n        //Load backgrund image\n        ImageIcon h = new ImageIcon("C:/Users/msp/Documents/NetBeansProjects/MyGame/src/mygamestart/bgGame.png");\n        bgGame = h.getImage();\n        \n        //Load house image\n        ImageIcon j = new ImageIcon("C:/Users/msp/Documents/NetBeansProjects/MyGame/src/mygamestart/roof.png");\n        roof = j.getImage();\n        \n        //Load car3 image\n        ImageIcon i = new ImageIcon("C:/Users/msp/Documents/NetBeansProjects/MyGame/src/mygamestart/car3.png");\n        car3 = i.getImage();\n\n        //Start posision of the car, car faces east.\n        x = 128;\n        y = 90;\n\nIn the background image I have painted some roads making it possible for the car image to follow. Now the car image always face east regardless what key is pressed, so it looks not so good :) I need help to turn this car in the face of the driving direction.\n\n\n    public void paint(Graphics g){\n        //Updates the picture to not to leave a trail\n        //creates a dbImage from current screen\n	dbImage = createImage(getWidth(), getHeight());   \n        //saves in dbg\n	dbg = dbImage.getGraphics();   \n        //grahphics to paintComponent\n	paintComponent(dbg); \n        //prints to this screen\n	g.drawImage(dbImage, 0, 0, this);     \n}\n\n        public void paintComponent(Graphics g){\n   //Constructor to print components to the screen and update the screen\n   g.drawImage(bgGame, 0, 0, this);\n   g.drawImage(roof, 127, 127, this);\n   //Prints the car to the screen\n   g.drawImage(car3, x, y, this);   \n        \n   //Prints FORZA 1.0 in Orange in the upper left corner\n   g.setFont(font);\n   g.setColor(Color.ORANGE);   //sets text collor\n   g.drawString("FORZA 1.0 ", 50, 50);\n\nrepaint();\n\n}\n\nI hope this will make it more understandable what I got stuck with and trying to do, facing the car image in the same direction as the pressed arrow key.\n\nBest regards,\nMikael

hi **UmutKader**\n\nwhy you are assuming that one card is already facing up ?\n\nif you initialize counter = 1, will never match with "NUMBER_OF_CARDS" when you traverse the array.\n\n    \n\n> 7 != 6\n\n**btw**: a boolean variable is unnecessary... ( you only need to check the counter ) :)\n\neasier to read if you write a **block_code** to traverse the array and increase the counter and separately another **block_code** to check if the counter matches with ....

Hi Mike,\n\nYour KeyAdapter looks good to me. I believe the part that you are not sure of is how to connect this KeyAdapter to the Canvas class as it is not a standard component in Java. To work around this, you can obtain the JPanel inside the Canvas and connect the KeyAdapter to it. The [javadoc of the Canvas class][1] will be useful.\n\nIf you are confused on what I am saying, you can take a look at the following sections of the Oracle Java tutorial first:\n\n - [Introduction to Event Listeners][2]\n - [General Information about Writing Event Listeners][3]\n - [Listeners Supported by Swing Components][4]\n - [How to Write a Key Listener][5]\n\nFor the key differences between a KeyListener and a KeyAdapter, you can take a look at the javadoc of the [KeyAdapter][6] class.\n\nLet us know how you are progressing. :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/Canvas.html\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/intro.html\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/generalrules.html\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/eventsandcomponents.html\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/keylistener.html\n  [6]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyAdapter.html

@MarvinWilliams2515\n\nmaybe the problem in your code is how your boolean variable is updated\n\n"NUMBER_OF_CARDS" variable is declared and initialized in MatchingGame.class (  in this game the value = 6 ), it is a public constant variable , so it can be invoked to be checked....\n\n\n**i)** to make it easy, you could declare a new variable into the method as a counter ( i.e. :  cardsFacingUp=0 )\n\n**ii)** if you traverse the whole array called "cards", and use the isFacingUp() method..........if a card is facing up then you must increase the counter.\n\n**iii)** lastly by using an if-else statement,... you have to return true or false if the counter is equal to  NUMBER_OF_CARDS\n\n\n\nI hope it was helpful

@EthanPernal\n\nThe problem described in this task  is asking you for design a private method to allow to **swap two Card_object elements into an array given and two indexes also given**.\n\n**setValue()** is a Card.class method not used to run the program\nis defined maybe for future purposes ( to develop the app in the future )\n\nthe **setValue()** method is not defined into "Java API Arrays", so it cannot be used to swap elements into the array\n\n* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html\n\n\nWhen you run the program MachingGame.class, a new object from GameBoard.class is created, see the picture below to understand how a GameBoard's object is created by the constructor.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n**Point 01)** There is an instance variable declared ( not initialized ), it an Array that contains Card's objects. In this case is declared as an empty array with 6 elements or Card.class, so:\n\n    \n\n> Card[] cards = { empty , empty , empty , empty , empty , empty }\n\n\n**Point 02)** When is invoked the constructor to create a GameBoard.class's object, there are to blocks of code.\n\n**Point 02 block 01)**  It going to fill the array named "cards" by adding Card.class's objects.\n\nA new "Card's objects" will be added in order into the array called "cards" by passing an value as a parameter.\n\n\n>     0 %(6/2)+1\n>     1   (int)\n>     1 %(6/2)+1\n>     2   (int)\n>     2 %(6/2)+1\n>     3   (int)\n>     3 %(6/2)+1\n>     1   (int)\n>     4 %(6/2)+1\n>     2   (int)\n>     5 %(6/2)+1\n>     3   (int)\n\nyou can see that only three values are generated...\n\nand running the for_loop six times, it is added six Card's objects into the array\n\n>     Card c = new Card(1);\n>     cards [0] = c;\n>     Card c = new Card(2);\n>     cards [1] = c;\n>     Card c = new Card(3);\n>     cards [2] = c;\n>     Card c = new Card(1);\n>     cards [3] = c;\n>     Card c = new Card(2);\n>     cards [4] = c;\n>     Card c = new Card(3);\n>     cards [5] = c;\n\nresulting :\n\n\n    \n\n> Card[] cards = { Card(1) , Card(2) , Card(3) , Card(1) , Card(2) , Card(3)  }\n\n**Point 02 block 02)** lastly, because the array is in order, the constructor is going to run another for_loop 100 times to swap all the Card.class's objects into the array. \n\nThis is doing by generating two random numbers that will be used as indexes to swap the array's elements.\n\n.. and by invoking the method named  "swapCards(int cardAIndex, int cardBIndex)", that you have to implement, the array will lost its order every time you execute the program. Given, for example, as result :\n\n    \n\n> Card[] cards = { Card(1) , Card(3) , Card(3) , Card(2) , Card(2) , Card(1)  }\n\nbecause the cards are hidden, you have to flip up them until you find the matched ones. \n\n\n----------\n\n\nrevise please this documentation, as is shown above\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html\n\nI will give you a small hint about working with arrays :\n\nAs the problem has indicated, an array is given and two indexes to be swapped are also given, the next example is giving with an array  filled with integers ( **not Card's objects** ):\n\nValues:\n\nint [] i = { 0 , **5** , 0 , 0 , 0  , **3** }; // array given\n\nand the indexes given to be swapped are : 1 and 5,\n\n....so i [ 1 ] = 5 and i [ 5 ] = 3;\n\nProcedure:\n\n**i)** to catch the value stored at index 1\n\nint temp1 = i [ 1 ];\n\n**ii)** to put that value into index 5\n\ni [ 5 ] = temp1;\n\n**iii)** resulting:\n\nint [] i = { 0 , **5** , 0 , 0 , 0  , **5** };\n\n**iv)** if you understand the procedure, to swap two elements will be easy.\n\n**you will have to store also the value of the element at index 5 before changing it ... [ repeat steps i) & ii) ]**\n\nbw: the exercise could be done in three lines of code....;)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14456824617297679.png\n\n

I have gotten the value of the first card to change but not the id using this code: \n        \n\n>     Card temp = new Card(1000);\n>     temp.setValue(cardAIndex);\n>     cards[cardAIndex].setValue(cardBIndex);\n\nI understand that the Object "temp" isn't doing anything and I tried to set the value of cardBIndex to temp but that didn't work because temp isn't an integer. Which makes sense to me. I'm just having trouble swapping both the ids and the values. \n

hi AnshulAggarwal,\n\nI believe you are talking about one of the graded problem tasks in Module 2. The statements/expressions used in these tasks are indeed IDE independent.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could tell us which of the graded problem tasks you are actually referring to. Posting the answer you expected and the steps you uses to arrive this answer will also be useful.\n\n:)

Hi Ricardo,\n\nThank you for your comments. You're right about "traverse", I was tempted to use it, but decided, badly, don't... Well, English is not my mother language, actually is Portuguese, so those mistakes happen some times... \n\nAbout the **index** variable on Sample 01. All right, you took the words from my mouth. On an academic point of view it's ok to reuse the loop variables, or keep them available for later use, but in the real world...? Anyway, who am I to talk about this, I used it thousands and thousands times in the past...\n\nLet me finish by thank you and all community for your support. I already completed this course and have my certificate and I'm waiting for the continuations.\n\nManuel Albuquerque

Perhaps let me add a point.\n\nThere is no restriction that we can only setup the user input in the main() method. For example, given the example by **Ricardo** above, we can have another method testing() that does the same job of asking for a number and outputting the square of that number:\n\n>     import comp102x.*;\n>     public class IOusage {\n>     \n>         public static void testing () {\n>             IO.output("write a num: ");\n>             double d = IO.inputDouble();\n>             IO.output("d*d: " + d*d );    \n>         }\n>     \n>         public static void main ( String[] args ) {\n>             IO.output("write a num: ");\n>             double d = IO.inputDouble();\n>             IO.output("d*d: " + d*d );    \n>         }\n>     }\n\nTo invoke the methods, just right-click on the IOusage class and click on the desired method name. One different worth pointing out is that the testing() method takes **no arguments** as opposed to the main method which takes a **String[] as an argument**. This explains the extra pop up window you see when you invoke the main() method. But don't worry about it now, methods arguments will be introduced in Module 3.\n\n:)

I think the compiler would give an error telling that there are no parameter types matching the type of the variables used to call the method or there are multiple matches.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The compiler will throw an error message because the values for q3 do not fit into any of the defined constructors.

Ok, let's add some comments about what the Samples 01 to 04 are doing (the Code Segments are all well commented on previous post by other students).\n\nSample 01: This piece of code travels the all the elements of *array* variable in search for the minimum value. The value is stored on variable **minValue** and displayed on the console at the end. The main difference between this code and similar pieces of code that we've seen on the class and on the practice is the fact that the other examples keep the index of the array where the minimum value is stored, but on this case we keep the minimum value itself.\n\nSample 02: The objective of this code is to count the number of odd numbers inside variable **array**. At a first glance I was surprised by the expression that constitutes the second operand of the **||** operator, because I'm not accustomed thinking in modulus of negative numbers, but of course they still exist!\n\nSample 03: This one may look a bit odd, but it isn't! The proposal it to travel all the elements of array variable **a** and increment by one each of them. The **for** loop is empty! Why? Because all the necessary work is done on the *increment* section of the **for** loop: **i++** increments by one the loop control variable and **a[...]++** increments by one the element of array **a**.\n\nSample 04: This code sums the product of each 2 elements of the array. Mathematically we could express it as:\n\n(element_1 x element_n) + (element_2 x element_(n- 1)) + ... + (element_(n- 1) x element_2) + (element_n x element_1)\n\nWhere: element_1 is the first element of the array (index 0), element_2 is the second element of the array (index 1) and element_n is the last element of the array (index array.length- 1).\n\nIn our case we have:\n\n(0 x 4) + (1 x 3) + (2 x 2) + (3 x 1) + (4 x 0)\n\nIt's a good exercise because it shows that the **for** loop can have more than one statement on the initialization and on the increment sections. It can also has more the one condition, but this was not used on the present sample.

Sorry guys but I think that the problem is well- defined because there is only ONE Best way - inspite of the various variations. In this day of technology it is possible to take several factors into account and come to a final solution which would give us the best way to travel. The problem is worded in a vague way which makes us think that its not possible but there is still a possibility of finding the best way - even I don't have the capacity to calculate or find it out yet.

The reason is the line that is\n\n    Q2.addTime(time1,time2);\n\nis trying to access a static method from class Q2.\n\nIn the code you provided addTime is an instance method.\n\nYou could change that line to\n\n    time1.addTime(time1,time2);\n\nor\n\n    time2.addTime(time1,time2);\n\nor\n\n    time3.addTime(time1,time2);\n\neach providing the same result because the method doesn't use the instance it's called from anyways.\n\nBecause the method makes no use of the instance it's called upon it should probably be made a static method instead of an instance method.\n\nA better instance method might be\n\n    Q2 addTime(Q2 t2) {\n    	Q2 t3 = new Q2(0,0,0);\n    	t3.hours = hours + t2.hours;\n    	t3.minutes = minutes + t2.minutes;\n    	...\n    	return t3;\n    }\n\nIn this case t1 is replaced with whatever instance called the addTime method.\n******\n\nQ2 variable = Q2.addTime(time1,time2);\n\nwould be equivalent to\n\nQ2 variable = time1.addTime(time2);\n******\nThere's also the option of making an instance method that returns void and adds another time to its self internally.\n\n    void addTimeToMe(Q2 timeToAdd){\n         hours +=  timeToAdd.hours;\n         ...\n    }\n\n

hi\n\n**Q2( int . . .,int ... ,int ... )** is the constructor of Q2.class\n\n**addTime (...)** is one method that needs to be passed two objects from Q2.class, that method is **typed "Q2"**, so it will return an object from Q2.class ( "**return t3;** ")\n\n\nthe problem in this program is that it contains two classes ( Q2.class and PassObj.class ) and some **modifiers** for class and methods are **missing** ( **to write a better readable code** ). [ it´s not a really nice programming practice ]\n\nrevise this documentation :\n\n*Controlling Access to Members of a Class*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html\n\n    \n\n> A class may be declared with the modifier public, in which case that\n> class is visible to all classes everywhere. **If a class has no modifier**\n> (the default, also known as package-private), it is **visible only\n> within its own package** (packages are named groups of related classes —\n> you will learn about them in a later lesson.)\n\n\n\nDoes it have sense to declare a method as "public" when its class has not got modifier "public", ( so the method is only accessible inside the package [ private (default) or protected ] )? \n\n\nI suggest you to **split** the code in two classes and add the modifiers necessary for better code understanding about "controlling access"\n\n

In simple terms, a Map is a collection of (key, value) pairs with no repeated keys. Both key and value are Objects in Java. We can put a key value pair, e.g. ("One", "1"), into a Map and then retrieve it by providing the key only. This is similar to an array using Objects as indices instead of integers. There are different implementation of Maps in Java. One of them is IdentityHashMap which considers two keys (k1, k2) to be equal when k1 == k2. The IdentifyHashMap utilizes the hash function, System.IdentityHashCode(), to speed up the searching process.\n\n<hr />\n\nThe following code constructs a IdentityHashMap and prints out it contents.\n\n\n>     import java.util.IdentityHashMap;\n>     import java.util.Map;\n>     \n>     public class IHMPrinting {\n>     \n>     	public static void main(String[] args) {\n>     		\n>     		Map<String, String> map = new IdentityHashMap<String, String>();\n>     		\n>     		map.put("key 1", "value 1");\n>     		map.put("key 2", "value 2");\n>     		\n>     		for (String key : map.keySet()) {\n>     			System.out.println(key + ", " + map.get(key));\n>     		}\n>     	}\n>     }\n\n<hr />\n\nHere are some more reference if you would like to read more:\n\n**Map:**\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Map.html\n\n**IdentityHashMap:**\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/IdentityHashMap.html\n\n**identityHashCode:**\n\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)\n\n**Hash Table:**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table

It is likely that the BlueJ is running on an older JDK version so that the compiled BouncingBalls class cannot be loaded by default. Please upgrade to the latest JDK version (8u60).\n\nYou will also need to configure BlueJ to select which JDK to use after the installation. Assuming you are using Windows 7, you can open the **"Select BlueJ VM"** tool under **"Start Menu" -> "All Programs" -> "BlueJ" -> "Select BlueJ VM"**. After that you will see a dialog like the following:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nSelect the newly installed JDK (should be jdk1.8.0_60 in your case).  You can also browse to the JDK in case it is not showing in the list. Click "Launch" afterwards. BlueJ is then configured to launch with the new JDK. Note that this process will only need to be done once. BlueJ will launch with the new JDK thereafter.\n\n:-)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14447906068136971.png

A car can be a form of abstraction.  A user of a car can operate a vehicle without having to know the ins and outs of how the vehicle is actually operating. The user can press on the gas pedal to move the car and press on the brakes when they would like to stop without knowing how the car is actually doing so. The cars "interface" (e.g. pedals, steering wheel, ignition, etc.) hide the complexity behind what is actually allowing the car to move. I think, abstraction is a way in which complexity is hidden that is not of immediate concern to the user in order to operate the program/machinery.

Thank You. I just thought that transistors would relate to processing power, but now it seems there is much more to learn.\n\nThe community TA is doing its job great. First time in on edX my question has been answered in nearly an hour, that too by a TA.

We are not supposed to know what is the propose of the **static** modifier yet, even so, I don't see any calling of non static methods...! We 2 objects (defaultIronMan and mark42); the methods called belong to the objects so I don's see any problem.\n\nTo clarify myself: if we have, inside the main(...) method:\n\nmark42.dance(); // This is Ok, because mark42 is an object that has a dance() method.\n\ndance(); // This would be wrong, because being **static**, method main(...) always exist (you don't need to create an object of IronMan class in order to call main(...)), but dance() will only exists as long as the object that has it still exist.

@ Rodolfo_L, It seams to me that all your 3 points are mentioned by bhasker29...!\n\n@ bhasker29, on line 30, they're trying to assign an **int** (givenId) to a **String** (id).
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The point is: **int** can be automatically cast to **double**, but the opposite is not true.\n\nThat's why\n1) Week3Quiz q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0);\nwill fail to compile (none of the constructors has 2 doubles as parameters).\n\n2) Week3Quiz q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10);\nwill fail to compile (automatically cast of the first parameter will match second defined constructor, BUT automatically cast of the second parameter will match the first defined constructor; both constructors will match and the compiler as no way to decide which one should be used).\n
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
The compiler will not be able to find a matching constructor and will have an error.

Hi David,\n\nAs Ricardo mentioned, the **Blockquote** and **Code sample** are only for better formatting the post contents. Unfortunately, the edX platform does not provide any means for making private posts to staff at this moment.\n\nI have also edited you post above, just leaving the essential parts for each of your attempts. We discourage posting content that directly hint the answer of any graded exercises as this is **against the edX honor code**. However, posting just a small portion of the code where you think the problem comes from is allowed. Ones should know that identifying the area of which the problem comes from is also an important aspect of learning how to solve problems.\n\nKeep it up and let us know if you have any further problems. :)\n

thank you

hi  BoaduDavid\n\nI suppose Leofan will answer you in some hours.\n\nBecause the code is not exactly the correct one I prefer to leave it ( I can edit it ) until Leofan revises it and decides to keep it or just leave some parts of your code.\n\n"**Blockquote**" & "**Code Sample**" buttons are used to better readable and presentation code into the board [ select the full code and then press any button or both untill you get the format you wish ] ( nothing about being visible only by staff ) \n\nYou can try them in any text box without submit a post. ( a preview is shown ) or open a new thread and then delete it after making your tests.\n\nVerify what options the board allows you to do with your first post [ initial thread ] and the other followed comments. [ edit, del, report ] ,... it's the button with three points\n \n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n\n**btw**: Could you solve this exercise ? \n\nnote: I have just formatted your several attempts in the correct way.\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14445865003506652.png

a mixer or grinder also uses abstraction as we are not bothered about whats happening inside the machine,we just rotate the knob of grinder and its speed varies accordingly.

I think you missed first line import package....\nimport comp102x.IO;\n
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
No, it is not a well-defined problem.  In order to solve it, you will need to know where in Honk Kong you are leaving and where in London you want to arrive.  You also need to know what if you want the cheapest or fastest route.  So, some very important components are missing to solving the problem.

Yes it is. Because for every meaning on each possible variable on the question (i.e london is in canada, better way means cheapest) and their combinations, there will be an answer that satisfies the question regardless. Well, at least theoretically.\nI could argue that 1 + 2 *3 = 9, and just after you apply rules to it, the correct is apparent, and the same is true for the question too.\nAfter all 1+2*3 is a well defined problem, right?

Hi,\n\nI believe you are referring to Lab 02 Task 1.\n\nIn this task, you are asked to write a program that asks the user to input two numbers and output the product of these two numbers. For example, if the user input 3 and 4, the program should output 12; if the user input 5 and 6, the program should output 30.\n\nNote that you should also output messages in specific formats for prompting the use inputs and outputting the answers. Please refer to the lab task page for more details.\n\nLet us know if you have further problems. :)\n

Hi georgia64,\n\nRicardo has given you some **very useful hints** in the above post. Following these hints will lead you to the correct answer, **please read them carefully**.\n\nI would also strongly recommend you to **code the program in the BlueJ first before submitting to the online grader**. You should check the output of the program against the description of the task page.

The question does not necessarily pose a "well-defined problem" because there are several answers which could fit right in this question. In short, there truly is not a single correct answer that could be formulated for this question. Furthermore, answers may vary depending on important factors (e.g. weather). Therefore, the question is not a well-defined problem.

In the lab tasks, you are required to **submit the implementation of the method body only**.  Take Lab 01 as an example, in BlueJ, you would probably have some code similar to the following:\n\n>     public class Lab01 {  \n>     \n>             public static void main(String[] args) { \n>                     // Please write your code after this line\n>                     System.out.println("first line");\n>                     System.out.println("second line");\n>                     System.out.println("third line");\n>     	      }\n>     \n>     }\n\nHowever, you will only need to submit the implementation of the main method, which is the following three lines.\n\n>     System.out.println("first line");\n>     System.out.println("second line");\n>     System.out.println("third line");\n\nWe will specify which method implementation you will need to submit in each of the subsequent lab exercises. So please get use to this format of submission. :)

5613f41101772be57d002d91
Hi Ethan,\n\nActually both of your questions are related to the concept of **precedence**. In Java, some operators have higher precedence and should be evaluated first. For example, given the following expression:\n\n> 1 + 2 * 3\n\nIt is equivalent to:\n\n> 1 + ( 2 * 3 )\n\nSince the * operator has a higher precedence than the + operator. So the evaluated value of this expression is 7 but not 9.\n\nFor a detailed list of operator precedence, you may refer to this post:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/55a3a430a9a36e1d46001685\n\n:)

Hi Ethan,\n\nThe message "int cannot be dereferenced" is probably caused by **redefining a local int variable "choice"** and trying to apply the dot operator on it for member accessing.\n\nThe following is a piece of code that **will cause the same error message**:\n\n>     int choice = [*Some Value*];\n>     if (choice.getType() == 0) {\n>      ...\n>     }\n\nPlease refer to the post by Ricardo above for more details on the task. :)

Let's take an example of Laptop/Thinkpad  that we use on a daily  basis . An End user who uses the Laptop need not to worry about how the processor, hard disk, keyboard,touch pad, speakers are built, he has to think/learn only about  using the Laptop. Also, if any of the hardware device such as cable,or chip is to be replaced with a new one, the overall functionality of it still remains the same. Hence data abstraction is about hiding the implementation details of data object from end user.\n.

hi  EthanPernal\n\nThe instance variable named "**choice**" **is already declared** into Computer.class\nso **you have only to initialize** that object from Choice.class by invoking the appropriate constructor, by passing an integer as an argument ( a random number stored previously generated by creating a Random.class object and invoking one method to generate numbers in range [0-3 [ ).\n\n***Computer.class***\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n***Choice.class***\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n**note**: the instance variable "choice" is an object from Choice.class so cannot be dereferenced into an integer.\n\n\nHope was helpful\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14441508863612659.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14441501595339442.png

I also don't understand this problem:\n\n>     if (a - b % 2 == 0) {\n>     \n>             System.out.println(100);\n>     \n>     } else if (a * b / c <= 5) {\n>     \n>             System.out.println(200);\n>     \n>     } else {\n>     \n>             System.out.println(300);\n>     \n>     }\n\nIt says that the answer is a=8, b=6, and c=6. I get why the if else statement is false but shouldnt the first if statement be true?

Tricky program, well designed to drive home the scope and class rules. My output:\nOne: 7, 5, 10\nTwo: 4, 5, 5\nMain: 5, 4, 5\nThe spaces are part of the output too :).\nOne more lesson I learned here: s.c, was never directly modified by 'this' keyword, so it will continue to change with instance variable c. But this is not the case for s.a, which was explicitly changed by 'this' keyword; any changes made to instance variable a will no longer reflect on s.a.

I tried making an if else statement branch which would return the corresponding random choice:\n        if (choice.getType() == 0){return 0;}\n        else if.......\n        else.......\n\nBut BJ is telling me "int cannot be dereferenced"

The given problem can be considered as well-defined problem because, there is a solution  means, if you start from Hong-Kong on a given day, you are destined to reach London as you already know the destination place, which solves part of the problem.Secondly, yes there are many possible ways say Best, Average and Worst, but in this question its strictly mentioned "best way to reach London from Hong-Kong" so in the list of possibilities two of them will be excluded. Now, in the fastest way many variants like time, means of transportation, deadline etc.. will come into picture. We being  humans have got brains to tackle the problem considering many variants and draw out a soultion, whereas for computer it can only think, if the variants are designed in its logic. Above points leads to saying, the problem has definite steps but one must know which method he is using.Therefore, its's a well-defined problem.

The compiler will  give an error. \n\n - for q1 can't find a suitable constructor for the object becouse there isn't  a double, double contructor \n - for q2 the compiler can't  choose the right contstructor because both match the requirements.  Infact  an integer can  be converted to double whthout any loss of information.

we also can consider online or in CD games ,we only consider how we should play or what actually the tactics to be used but we don't  go on the software  behind it . this it is example of abstraction of functionality

code segment 1: error - declaration and initialization must be done 1n a single statement.\n\ncode segment 2: output should be 3234.\n\ncode segment 3: error because array are declared with square brackets not ().\n\ncode segment 4: output should be 0123\n\ncode segment 5: error array should be declared as type double.

my observations are:\n1. There is no main() method in the class.\n2. As it is, the program will keep printing the 9th floor.\n3. To correct the problem, we need to:\n     a. move the semi colon at line 35 to the end of the line.\n     b. add line 29 as: currentFloor--;\n     c. change lne 27 ">" to ">=" to enable printing of 1st floor.\n4. From line 44 to 53, there is no default symbol if the all the "if statements" are not met.\n     a. add line 53 as follows: else symbol="_";\n
560e73d401772bf07a002c07
Added: You are correct that there should be no return statement as the return type of the method is **`void`**, which means nothing in Java.

Hi Ethan,\n\nPlease make sure if you have followed all three steps in the lab task instruction:\n\n1. Select from 0, 1 or 2 randomly to imitate the computer making a random choice between rock, paper and scissors.\n<hr />\n2. A Random object can be created to select random integers in a specified range.\n<hr />\n3. Assign a new Choice instance to the instance variable "choice" of the Computer instance according to the random integer generated. You can use the Choice constructor that takes 1 integer argument for creating the new Choice instance.\n\nYou are also suggested to test the implementation before submitting the code. Please refer to the testing section in the lab task page.\n\nFeel free to tell us if it works or not. :)

The **`static`** keyword is used to indicate that a variable or a method belongs to a class but not an object. The lab task require us to finish the implementation of a method. You may want to refer to the following article for how to use the **`static`** keyword correctly.\n\n**Understanding Class Members**\n\n - https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html\n\nThere might also be some a potential problem in the code. Please make sure that your program runs as the screen capture indicated as follows:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/lab_02_graded_task_1_sample.png

I just though of a projector. If I want to project a video all I care about is the projector's light displaying my video  on a physical surface (functionality). I really do not consider how the projector does it.
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
An example I can think of is a video game. We use the video game controller to press a button, which then translates to an action being performed on the screen.

I didn't notice that one, but I believe you are right. I noticed two more issues:\n\nThere is no constructor for creating an Ironman without arguments. I.e. we would need to add the following code in line 16: \n\n    public void IronMan(){}\n\nThis will allow us to construct the defaultIronMan.\n\nThe second error I noticed is on line 32 for the getname method.

It is not a well-defined question as the 'best way' could mean cheapest, shortest, quickest. Plus the mode of transport is not specified, and the specific 'Hong Kong' and 'London' are not confirmed.

A few examples of abstraction are cell phones, tablets, automatic doors, windmills, cars, and heaters. There are a ton more though, so this is just a very small portion of the bigger picture.

Language. Of course all "concepts" are abstractions, such as: "Justice". But also: "the law". And even all categorical words, there is no "the horse".  \nMathematics, which is also a kind of language, is even more of an abstraction. Who has ever seen "1"? What is it? Does it exist anywhere?\n

I think that to travel from Hong Kong to London are involved several variables from wake up early until get the hotel (for example). But the best way is to make a plan so it can be a structure what the is the best path of directions (airport, fly, path, etc.).\n\nThe example above is so detailed, but if it can be minimized to take the airplane to get the London airport, it will more simply. It depends how we see the solution.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I believe the statement is missing some details in defining what would be the, "best way" to travel. For some it's the fastest, others think cheapest, some would want both. Then the next issued would be sorting out the finite number of steps to find the solution to this.

Hi Mike,\n\nThere is no method with name "input" in the IO class. So when we code "IO.input();" and compile the program, Java will complain by giving the message "cannot find symbol - method input()".\n\nYou may refer to the [documentation of the IO class][1] for a list of available methods that you can call. Depending on the type of input we want to read, we would call the appropriate method of the IO class. For example, if we would like to read an integer, we would call:\n\n> `IO.inputInteger()`\n\nIf we would like to read some text (a character string), we would call:\n\n> `IO.inputString()`\n\nFor the documentation of the entire course library, you can find it under the [Resources page][2] of the course web site.\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\nYou will find the documentation useful as you progress through the course. :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/IO.html\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/f792f3a2057040aa959e606d687e9bc4/\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14437154107472976.png

A perfect example of abstraction would be a traffic light.  The driver is able to take certain actions based on the color showing (Red, Yellow, Green).   Neither the driver nor the  traffic light care about the internal working of the other.  They simply use the color coding system to communicate.

compiler will show an error for q3 but would execute statement for q4 as domain of int is subset of domain of double, so int value can be equal to double value but vice versa is not possible

At first, I thought this was a well-defined problem, but I can see why it isn't. The key is the the question says "finding the best way." The key word here is "best." "Best" is subjective term. Best could mean cheapest, it could mean fastest, etc... The question needs to be objective.

An example of abstraction could be a keyboard. You can design a keyboard to feel different, look different, light up, or even fold into two pieces but when I press the "t" "a" or "h" key I expect the letters to come up respectively. The physical design of the keyboard is should be separate from its functionality as a keyboard.

That statement, I believe, is not a well defined problem.\nIn first place all the variables are not well explained. For example, to what place in London do we want to arrive or from wich place of Hong Kong do we want to depart; also the term "best way" is ambiguous. For a business trip,the best way might be the fastest way, however, for a familiy trip the best way will probably be the most comfortable way. To obtain a well-defined problem, we will need to control every posible varibable in order an absolute control of the outcome.\n\n

1. The constructor requires a string parameter for DefaultIronMan else another constructor is required for this\n\n2. public void IronMan(String newID) will not return the value id because there s no return statement.\n\n3. The method "public void getName" does not returr anything. The declaration should be "public string getName"\n\n4, Similarly public setID(int givenId) will require a return statement\n\n
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
Since the parameters do not fit any of the constructors given, some error message should be given by the compiler.

the problem is not well defined,there are numerous routes and means of transportation from Hong Kong to London thus by land, water, air and with a variety of vehicle, also the term best is vague, best in terms of what, safety, speed, comfort or what.

It is not a well defined problem, because it does not specify where in London are the plans for travel.

An example of data abstraction would be a computer. We use it, but most people don't care about the pieces used to make a computer, or the software that goes into it.\nAnother example would be a digital thermometer. We use digital thermometers to find out the temperature of a place, or if a person has fever, but most people don't know how it works.\nClocks are also an example of abstraction. We can see the time in clocks but most people wouldn't know how to build a clock.

I corrected the error showed above, but now it says that:\n\n - The dimension of Canvas object is incorrect. The width of Canvas object should be total width of the three images plus two blank areas which are between images. The width of each blank area should be 10 units. \n\n\nI used: \n         \n         canvas.add(image1, 0, 0);\n         canvas.add(image2, image1.getWidth() + 10, 0);\n         canvas.add(image3, image1.getWidth() + image2.getWidth() + 20, 0);\nat the end of my code.

The submitted code might use a variable before it is declared or there may be a typo mistake on the variable name. You may check spelling and letter cases of the identifiers. If you have declared some variables not inside the method imageAddition in your local BlueJ project, you should put the declarations in the textbox.\n\n2.

Yes, as you could only modify the body of the method, import statements as well as [static import statements][1] will not be included in the grader. Please using qualify references for accessing static members of the math class as illustrated above. \n\n\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/static-import.html

Given the code segments:\n\n**Segment 1:**\n\n>     String s = "java is awesome";\n>     \n>     for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {\n>         // code\n>     }\n\n**Segment 2:**\n\n>     String s = "java is awesome";\n>     \n>     for (int i = 0, len = s.length(); i < len; i++) {\n>         // code\n>     }\n\n**Segment 2** actually has better performance theoretically. This is because in each loop execution, the Boolean expression in the conditional part is evaluated once. Instead of making a method call to obtain the operands for the Boolean expression like that in **Segment 1**, **Segment 2** just read the operand from a local variable (**len**) saved during initialization of the for loop. **This saves the overhead of repeatedly updating the call stack and avoid recalculation of the same result each time.** In practical, unless the method being called is computational intensive, the overall execution time for the two different approaches should be comparable.\n\n<hr>\nFor the code segment from the Flipping Card game:\n\n>     for (int i = 0; i < MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS; i++) { \n>         // Code \n>     }\n\nSince **MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS** is a constant class variable (i.e. **final** and **static**). The Java compiler automatically optimize the code during compilation. For example, if **MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS** equals to 6, the logic represented by the byte code after compilation would be:\n\n>     for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) { \n>         // Code \n>     }\n\nNote the replacement of **MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS** by **6**.

no,  local loop control variables are checked once at the begining, then for_loop will check always the loop condition ( so it is calling "len" or "length() method" )\n\n\n> for ( int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++ ) { ... }\n\n* **The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed ONCE, as the loop begins**.\n* When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.\n`\n\n> i < s.length()  // **it will be evaluated untill it is false**\n\n* The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.
55f7e9d301772b1b0c0017c8
I'll try to make what i'm asking about more clearer, Suppose you have the following code block:\n\n    String s = "java is awesome";\n\n    // Assume that stringlen() is a method returning the length of a string\n    for (int i = 0; i < stringlen(s); i++) {\n        // code\n    }\nIn every iteration of the preceding loop, you are checking whether\n`i < stringlen(s)`, but in this case, in every iteration you are calling `stringlen(s)` to compute the length of `s` which is a constant number.\nSo in this case we are decreasing the performance (runtime). So it's better to do the following code instead:\n\n    String s = "java is awesome";\n\n    for (int i = 0, len = stringlen(s); i < len; i++) {\n        // code\n    }\n\nHere, we are not computing the string length in every iteration. Instead, we are assigning it to `len` and then checking `i < len` which increase the efficiency of the program and make it run faster.\n\nThat's why I asked my question above to know whether it's the same idea or not (whether `MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS` is decreasing the perfomance of the program or not).

The first and second arguments of the constructor are\n> the width and the height of the ColorImage. You can obtain the width\n> and height of a ColorImage by using the getWidth() and getHeight()\n> methods in the ColorImage class.\n\nyour code is not following the instructions because it is creating a canvas by using a Canvas default constructor \n\n\n>     Canvas()\n>     Constructs and shows a canvas with size 800 x 600.\n\n... you must use another constructor to create a canvas according with the picture's size previously loaded ( any picture ). \n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/index.html\n\nSo, use these variables that you had stored into : width and height, to create a canvas using those dimensions.\n

This is just an example of real world problem, how to execute the solution of the given problem is up to us in our hand. There are several factor's and different situations depending on what the person want's to be done, means suppose a person wants to go London(U.K.) he/she doesn't  care about time just want to enjoy the journey then they can take a long route through ship and at the same time a businessman don't have much time so he will take direct flight to desire place. The same problem statement can be treated as differently for different person's. 
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
Constructor missmatch will occur while creating the constructor in main method because no appropriate type argument found in parameter list. so the compiler will stuck at the declaration \nof new constructor.

Thanks RicardoAbian\n\nA little hard to follow the thread.\nMy understanding is:\n\n1.  all the png images are positioned correctly on the canvas at 0,480,0\n2.  in the test code if you try and position them elsewhere on the canvas, say 10,-30,180, the fact that you have set x,y,r @ 0,480,0 respectively shows that your code is correct as the png image isn't put at 10,-30,180...?

Our brain abstract many things in our lives. \nFor example, the functionality of our bodies.\nWe don't even know, sometimes, how properly to give some instructions to the body, but it moves by itself.\nWe don't need to know how a heart function to it beat.\nWe don't need to know how a brain thinks to it think.\nAnd our senses, every senses of our body is an abstraction of the overflowing data around the reality. We abstract all the light incoming to our eyes so we can interpret this data to a useful response, for example, reading this sentence.\n\n:D

The problem starts with the own words of "well defined", because even the "well defined" it's not well defined. There are many variables in the subject and the problems start to occur even in the phrase.\n\nThrough out of this the human race (and other animals) developed a mechanism that they simplify some of the variables deciding automatically the decisions and assuming in this "auto pilot". \nUsually we call it instinct, but the names may vary.\n\nSo the animals can decide fast enough to be useful relying in the "Instinct Service", and the machines lack this "Service" that runs in backround. The machines need ALL the instructions before work properly, and animals don't.\n\nSo the "well defined" must be defined before someone take futher actions.\n\n:D

The keyword 'Class' should be lowercase 'class'.\n\nThe first line of code within the 'main' method contains three errors: \n\n 1. IO-output is not a valid identifier, so it's not a valid name of a method. It probably should be IO.output. Actually, what I'd expect the compiler to attempt here is to subtract identifier 'output' from identifier 'IO' and use that result as a function. Since output is not defined, I'd expect the error to be 'undefined identifier "output"'.\n 2. Single quotes are used for single characters, not for strings. Double quotes should be used here.\n 3. The comma at the end of the line should be a semi-colon (I'm actually not sure about whether this really is syntactically incorrect).\n\nThe third line within the 'main' method uses an identifier 'Celsius' which is undefined. This should be 'celsius'.\n\nThe last line of the method contains three errors:\n\n 1. Floats cannot be added to strings. The floating point values should be cast to string first to obtain string concatenation.\n 2. The identifier 'fahranheit' is used, but this is not defined. It should be 'fahr**e**nheit'.\n 3. There's a missing semicolon at the end of the line.\n\nFinally, since IO is being used, there should be an import statement for that.

well, there are endless examples of data abstraction in our day to day life. starting from the alarm clock, our mobile phones, washing machines, television sets, laptops, food processors, refrigerators,light switches, search engines, atm machine, car navigation systems, air-conditioners, servers, all that we use, we use them because of their abstracting functionality. we aren't concerned about how they work and how's that's all happening.

Yes, one of the common use of methods with void as the return type is to alternate the state of an object (i.e. changing its internal values). void methods can also be used to perform some other duties like outputting on the terminal window. 
55f20f5d9714b0f62a0000ad
Constructor of a class is called during object creation and its main duty is to initialize the class members of the object to be created. The parameters of a constructor assist in initializing the object.\n\n\n>     public class IPhone6S\n>     {\n>         private int storageInGB;\n>         private String finish;\n>         \n>         public IPhone6S() {\n>             storageInGB = 16;\n>             finish = "Space Gray";\n>         }\n>         \n>         public IPhone6S(int s, String f) {\n>             storageInGB = s;\n>             finish = f;\n>         }\n>         \n>         public void outputSpec() {\n>             System.out.println("iPhone 6S (" + finish + ", " + storageInGB + "GB)");\n>         }\n>         \n>         public static void main(String[] args) {\n>             \n>             IPhone6S defaultPhone = new IPhone6S();\n>             IPhone6S customizedPhone = new IPhone6S(64, "Rose Gold");\n>             \n>             defaultPhone.outputSpec();\n>             customizedPhone.outputSpec();\n>         }\n>     }\n\nThe class above has two class members, namely **storageInGB** and **finish**. This class also has two constructors.\n\nThe first constructor has no parameters. IPhone6S objects created using this constructor will have default specifications (i.e. 16GB, "Space Gray").\n\nThe second constructor has two parameters. IPhone6S objects created using this constructor are customized according to the parameters (i.e. 64GB, "Rose Gold"). We can also pass in different parameters to this constructor for creating IPhone6S objects with different customization.\n\nHere is the execution result of the main() method:\n\n>     iPhone 6S (Space Gray, 16GB)\n>     iPhone 6S (Rose Gold, 64GB)\n\nYou can also try to create customized IPhone6S object by passing different  parameters to the constructor.\n\n:)

If both of the values are the same, it is acceptable to return either one as the "greater" one. This implementation is also adopted in the [max(int, int) method][1] of the Math library in Java:\n\n>     public static int max(int a, int b)\n>     \n>     Returns the greater of two int values. That is, the result is \n>     the argument closer to the value of Integer.MAX_VALUE. If the arguments have the same value, the result is that same value.\n>     \n>     Parameters:\n>     a - an argument.\n>     b - another argument.\n>     \n>     Returns:\n>     the larger of a and b.\n\nOf course, it is also possible to implement our own version of the max() method which handles differently in the case of same values. For example, we can have a max() method that returns -1 if both values are the same, assuming the input are only non-negative integers.\n\nRevise the different cases by Ricardo above and you will know how to implement this. :)\n\n  [1]: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#max%28int,%20int%29

We should assign the new Choice instance to the **instance variable "choice"**. What the code currently doing is assigning the new Choice instance to a **local int variable "randChoice"**.\n\nMoreover, we will not need a return statement for this method. You may refer to the following post for details.\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/55f0b6ee01772b2d700013b6

Note that the method **makeChoice()** has a return type of **void** which means nothing. If we try to return any value/object in this method, Java will complain that it is not expecting any return value. So what we need to do is to remove the return statement.\n\nYou might also want to take a look at instruction 3. carefully:\n\n> **Assign a new Choice instance to the instance variable "choice"** of the\n> Computer instance according to the random integer generated. You can\n> use the Choice constructor that takes 1 integer argument for creating\n> the new Choice instance.

int can easily be converted to double,in other words could be casted. Whereas, double can't be cased to a lower datatype like int in this case. Thus an error gets detected since there is a mismatch with the arguments considering neither of the constructor matches the parameter in the main method.

This still doesn't help :(\n\nSo what you're saying, if I'm understanding correctly, is that Java automatically makes the numbers of the same type (sort of like when adding fractions, you make the bottom the same to make things easier).\n\nMy equation -5 + 14 / 6 + 2.0 develops as follows:\n\nI do division first, right? - but how do I know if the result should be integer or floating point?\n\nThe resulting options are:\n> -5 + 2.3 + 2.0\n\nand\n\n> -5 + 2 + 2.0\n\nThen I add the first two digits together. \n\nThis gets me \n> -2.7 + 2.0\n\nand\n\n> -3 + 2.0\n\nSo the results can be either -0.7 or -1.0, neither of which are correct. \n\nI'm struggling to understand where I'm going wrong with this.

You will need a **if-else-if statement** for this task instead of a switch statement. This is because we need to perform different actions according to three ranges of values.\n\nrange 1: **inputDisparity** smaller than 0\naction 1: return 0\n\nrange 2: **inputDisparity** larger then half of image width\naction 2: return half of image width\n\nrange 3: not in range 1 and range 2\naction 3: return **inputDisparity**\n\nA switch statement would not be possible as we cannot determine how many cases will there be.

Hi Derzu,\n\nIt's always clever to ask questions for clearing doubts! So don't feel bad. :)\n\nActually this lab task is about finding the **solutions** to a quadratic equation in the form of $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. That is, given the values of $a, b$ and $c$, we would like to find the values of $x$ such that the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is satisfied.\n\nThe first value of x is given by the equation:\n\n$x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$\n\nThe second value of x is given by the equation:\n\n$\nx = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$\n\nSo the calculation of the two x, (x1 and x2) are not correct in your code.\n\nYou may referring to the following post for more hints:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/55e6e66801772b5ea6000ecc\n\n

The result of the expression should be a floating point number. Note that for the arithmetic operations, Java perform automatic widening conversion of the operands in case they are not in the same type ([reference][1]). For example, the expression **"1 + 2.0"** is evaluated as follows:\n\n> **1 + 2.0 => 1.0 + 2.0 => 3.0**\n\nAlso note that most binary operators are left associative. Which means they should be evaluated from left to right. For example:\n\n> **1 + 2 + 3 => 3 + 3 => 6**\n\nbut **NOT**\n\n> **1 + 2 + 3 => 1 + 5 => 6**\n\nAlthough the result looks the same when doing just addition or multiplication, it would be a different story when the expression involve subtraction and division.\n\n:)\n\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.6.2

I would imagine the compiler would throw an error since the args do not match the constructor parameters. Otherwise possibly just taking whichever arg it matched up first to the first parameter of the constructor and default typecasting the second that didnt match.

I think it is not a well-defined problem. It never specifies what it is supposed to be "the best way", maybe the fastest? the safest? Just this question is by itself too subjective and set out many variables and therefore can not give a "well defined solution" that can be reached by a finite number of steps. Even if the best way means the cheapest one, for expample, we may need to know what season are we talking about. Other issues can be found, for expample, problem doesnt provides precise locations (airport? downtown? etc)

According to me the problem statement is a well defined problem.As according to the definition mentioned by the professor it clearly states that:\n1.A solution must exist (which it does).\n2.Finite number of ways to achieve the desired solution (also exists).\nTaking into account what mode of transportation needs to be used to reach,should it be the fastest or the cheapest route would vary from person to person as desired by them.\nHence it is a well defined problem.

when you type in something on google you are only interested in the results and not the background information of how the results were got.

I believe the default values will be displayed. I feel this way because most Java values must be initialized before they are used, and I think its because of this situation in question.  
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
I think that the default values will be displayed. I am basing this off the normal function of most computer systems. If there is no new information introduced then the computer reverts back to the default instructions.

One example would be to look at how a car works, when we press the gas paddle we are not thinking about how the car is pushing foreward. all we consider is that we should be accelerating when we press the gas paddle. we are not concerned with the inner workings of the engine and pistons transferring the energy to the drivetrain. all we think about is gas paddle = movement and brakes = slow down.

I'm not really sure "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is a well-defined problem,although we have the start point and end point,and the process is "travel",but it's hard to defined "the best way" for the travel activity,by which transport system? and what's the climate substances like in two location? and the best means? maybe faster,comfortable,cheaper etc. so it's not really well-defined problem for "Finding the best way to travel Hong Kong to London.

Thanks for your reply.\n\n1) The statement "int result = computer.getChoice().getType();" is part of testcase1().  It is a valid statement.\n\n2) The statement "Choice choice = new Choice (i);" is the problem.  Thanks.  You are right, I am trying to redefine an already declared variable "choice".  Module 4 is about scope, and that was my problem.  The compiler allowed me to use this statement to define a LOCAL variable called 'choice', valid only within the method makeChoice().  Instead of defining a new variable, the correct statement to use is one of the following:\n\nchoice = new Choice (i);\nthis.choice = new Choice (i);\n\nThanks for your help.

I am also getting incorrect answer, despite marking what I believe, is the right answer. My values are different from yours. That said, think about you 3rd set of values (7,14,6). The code is likely not going to evaluate to 2. Will the 'else x = 2' even be executed?

I don't think "finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is a well-defined problem. Simply because a well defined problem means that when you hear the situation, you don't have to clarify or ask anything. For this specific problem, I don't know where in London, I don't know what type of transportation I want to get there by (train, plane, etc.), and I don't know if the best way means cost efficient, less time consuming, or something else.

It seems our daily life is full of examples of abstraction. One example I would like to mention is the interface of ATM machines. One focuses on the different functionality instead of the detail mechanical parts inside the machine. If something in the machine needs to be changed or becomes broken, that wouldn't affect the interface

"Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" it's not a well-defined problem. As mentioned by the other participants, with whom I agree, the problem is to vague to be well-defined. What should we understand by "best way"? How would we travel? From where in Hong Kong to where in London? What London? Who would travel? People, animals, ...? How many? For example: The best way for a person to travel may not be the best way for a group of people to do so. And their age and state of health would make a great difference to.

The values don't match the types for the constructors so the program can't compile.  It will only compile if it can work out a way to satisfy the parameters of the constructor. (Am I using the term parameters correctly here?)  The program is able to compile when the values are reversed or when they match.  But the compiler has difficulty distinguishing between the two constructors because they are too similar.  Only certain test cases will work for this program.

The first statement would result in an error. One can't allocate a double to an integer.\nThe second statement is fine, since an integer can be allocated to a double variable.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
I suppose the compiler will notify an error because it can't find a constructor with two double parameter.\n

**The value of c is modified**, both in the method one(int, int) and two(int, int). This is because the entire program only has one variable **c** defined and that is the instance variable **c**. So when even we refer to **c** in the instance methods one(int, int) and two(int, int), we are referring to the instance variable **c**.

----------\n\n\nThank you for your feedback, evhiness.\n\nConsidering this as an introductory java programming course, we believe the current grading scheme should be appropriate as the exam was specifically designed so that it would be quite difficult for programming beginners to complete. However, we do believe that learners should attempt most of the programming exercise in each module in order to master the programming concepts.\n\nIn fact, when the course was offered in cohort-based manner for 5 weeks, the final exam is only released in the final week for a limited period of time. So learners will have to pay more effort working on the weekly programming assessments in order to secure a certificate. We would like to retain this setting in the current self-paced mode but unfortunately, after a few meetings with the edX technical team, we found out that it is not possible for us to release materials according to the learners' progress.

In additional to the barcode format, other factors like resolution, contrast, shape ... etc will also affect the recognition result. Just like any other programs, in order to produce the desired output, we will have to give the appropriate input to the program.

**NO**, it means that if you do not provide a constructor in your class, Java will create automatically a constructor with no arguments and no scope.

If you are asking why the values 90.0, 80.0 & 70.0 end up in the parameters of the computeGrade() method, it is because the setFinalGrade() method passes the value of the instance variables to the computeGrade() method. \n\nIn the video, the setFinalGrade() method is invoked. If we invoke the computeGrade() method instead, BlueJ will give a prompt dialog asking the values to be passed.\n\nHaving the same name as the instance variables doesn't cause the parameters of the computeGrade() method to copy the values from the instance variables.\n\nIf you are asking how to reference variables of the same name in different scopes, please refer to the detailed explanation by Ricardo above.\n\n:)\n

According to the edX documentation ([link][1]), it is possible to request the certificate for more than once. However, we could not locate the re-request mechanism on the course web site. Therefore, we suggest you to contact edX ([link][2]) to request the certificate again according to your latest verification status. If re-generation of the certificate is not possible, you can still request for a refund.\n\n  [1]: http://edx-guide-for-students.readthedocs.org/en/latest/SFD_certificates.html#on-demand-certificates\n  [2]: https://www.edx.org/contact-us

In order to use the methods of the IO class, we will need to do  two things:\n\n1. Copy the course libraries into the project directory\n2. Write the import statement\n\nWe have included the course libraries in the projects provided on the course site. So if you delete all the code in an existing project except the import statement "import comp102x.IO;", everything will work fine. However, if you create a new project, the course libraries will not be there by default. Please refer to the following post for setting up the course libraries:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m2a/threads/559fda21b30d8499560014db

@Bjjones777\n\nIt is not recommended to use MSWord to edit the java source file as MSWord will perform some auto formatting of characters and is likely to cause some unexpected compilation errors if the wrong file format is chosen during saving. Moreover, you might have to do a manual compilation of the Java source code after editing.\n\nWe would recommend using a proper software for editing, compiling and executing Java programs. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as BlueJ is a convenient software for such purpose. You may refer to the [Pre-course Materials][1] for setting up Java and BlueJ in your computer.\n\n:)\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/courseware/ae687c1204b84885a4797f517715722a/3febc247861d4c40a7dcf08789729a58/1

When the parameter is set as double, and an integer is entered, it will convert it to a double.  When the parameter is set as an integer, and a double is entered, it would cause an error when compiling.  So one set of parameters, where they are both integers would work, but the one where they are both double would cause an error.

**`static`** methods are methods belong to a class and are used to access other class members only.\n\nSuppose we have the following class and we create two Person instances with names "Peter" and "Mary".\n\n>     public class Person {\n>     	\n>     	  private String name;\n>     	\n>     	  public Person(String newName) {\n>     		\n>             name = newName;\n>     	  }\n>     	\n>     	  public static void main(String[] args) {\n>     		\n>     	      Person p1 = new Person("Peter");\n>     	      Person p2 = new Person("Mary");\n>         }\n>     }\n\nSuppose now we wish to add a method in the class for modifying the names of the Person instances. It would not be reasonable to add a static method as **the names "Peter" and "Mary" belong to two different Person instances but not the Person class**. Adding a **`static`** method for accessing instance members will result in a compilation error.\n\n>     public static void updateName(String newName) {\n>     		\n>         name = newName;\n>     }\n\n**Error message: Cannot make a static reference to the non-static field name.**\n\nUsing an **`instance`** method presents no problems.\n\n>     public void updateName(String newName) {\n>     		\n>         name = newName;\n>     }\n\nSo in general, we make a method static when:\n\n1. It does not need to access instance variables.\n2. We wish to invoke the method without creating an instance.\n\n[Here][1] is a good article about when to use static methods in Java. It involves some concepts not covered in this course, but you can treat it as an extra reading material. :)\n\n\n  [1]: http://javarevisited.blogspot.hk/2013/07/when-to-make-method-static-in-java.html

This is a problem related to TESTING...while testing we are supposed to put a value that satisfies the current values..and the boundary conditions ...and conditions that lie outside the boundary to show that the program gives the desired output in all the conditions \n\nIt means that if the values lie outside it should give an error and if values lie inside it should run properly. These are called test cases.\n\nSo the conditions that could be tries are ...... \n\n*Edited by TAC, pls avoid to put answers into the board*

My example: Cell Phones and Service Providers\n\nWe always are using cell phones and expect them to work properly. Whenever our cell phones start to act up, or don't send a message perhaps, we instantly come to the conclusion that our service provider is to blame. In reality however, it just might be that there is something wrong with the messenger program on our phones instead of the service provide's network signal.

hi Farouk-Sabry\n\nas sample, all Math.class's methods, are ALL declared with the "modifier" **static**\n\n* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html\n\n    static means that the method is associated with the class, not a specific instance (object) of that class. **This means also that you can call a static method without creating an object of the class**.\n\n\nSo, invoking these public static methods could be NOT necessary to create firstly an object of that class and can be invoked directly referring with the class name.\n\n\nsample : \n\n> Math.sqrt(10);\n\n\n... this keyword "static" can be also used for fields ( variables )\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html

After having been a computer and electronics technician for over 30 years, part of my job was to know about most of the ways that most of the items I dealt with worked in order to repair them. Most people don't care of how they work as long as the item works. When it stops working, they take it to somebody that knows to fixit, or throw it away and buy a new one.

***Primitive Data Types***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html\n\n> **int**: By default, the int data type is a **32-bit** signed two's complement\n> integer, which has a minimum value of -2^31 and a maximum value of\n> 2^31-1.

Hi \n\nsorry for the delay, but I am not an expert in C++, only an user of Visual Basic with Visual Studio.\n\nI think the concept in Java you are referring is named (constructors and methods) "**overload/ing**", same concept is used in Visual Basic. I leave some references here:\n\n***The Java® Language Specification. Java SE 7 Edition. Chapter 8. Classes***\n\n\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html\n\n> Method names may be overloaded (§8.4.9).\n> \n> Constructors (§8.8) are similar to methods, but cannot be invoked\n> directly by a method call; they are used to initialize new class\n> instances. Like methods, they may be overloaded (§8.8.8).\n\n\n\n\n*8.8.8. Constructor Overloading*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.8.8\n\n> Overloading of constructors is identical in behavior to overloading of\n> methods (§8.4.9). The overloading is resolved at compile time by each\n> class instance creation expression (§15.9).\n\n*8.4.9. Overloading*\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-8.html#jls-8.4.9\n\n> If two methods of a class (whether both declared in the same class, or\n> both inherited by a class, or one declared and one inherited) have the\n> same name but signatures that are not override-equivalent, then the\n> method name is said to be overloaded.\n> ...\n> When a method is invoked (§15.12), the number of actual arguments (and\n> any explicit type arguments) and the compile-time types of the\n> arguments are used, at compile time, to determine the signature of the\n> method that will be invoked (§15.12.2). If the method that is to be\n> invoked is an instance method, the actual method to be invoked will be\n> determined at run time, using dynamic method lookup (§15.12.4).\n\n\n***The Java™ Tutorials. Defining Methods. Overloading Methods***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/methods.html\n\n> The Java programming language supports overloading methods, and Java\n> can distinguish between methods with different method signatures. This\n> means that methods within a class can have the **same name** if they have\n> **different parameter** lists (there are some qualifications to this that\n> will be discussed in the lesson titled "Interfaces and Inheritance").\n\n\n***[ACTIVITY] Module 03 Multiple Constructors***\n\n...an example of constructor "overloading" \n\n* https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m3c/threads/559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f\n

I guess this post should answer your question:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/827785/why-doesnt-java-have-a-copy-constructor\n\n:)
55d602659714b07ea70001a9
These two concepts would be better illustrated by going through an example.\n\nLet's say we have the following class which has 4 methods:\n\n>     public class MyClass\n>     {\n>         public static void publicStaticMethod() {\n>             System.out.println("Calling public static method.");\n>         }\n>         \n>         private static void privateStaticMethod() {\n>             System.out.println("Calling private static method.");\n>         }\n>         \n>         public void publicMethod() {\n>             System.out.println("Calling public method.");\n>         }\n>         \n>         private void privateMethod() {\n>             System.out.println("Calling private method.");\n>         }\n>     }\n\nAs it has been mentioned:\n\n> static means that the method is associated with the class, not a\n> specific instance (object) of that class. This means that you can call\n> a static method without creating an object of the class.\n\nSo, in BlueJ, we can invoke the static method by right clicking on the class and invoke it directly:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nAs you might have observed, we have two **`static`** method declared, but only one is showing on the image above. This is the what the **`private`** and **`public`** keyword does. **`public`** means it is publicly available for calling and **`private`** means that the method is callable only inside the class. **`private`** methods are methods intended for the **designer** of the class to organize and re-use his/her code and are intended to be hidden from the **user** of the class.\n\nFor the **instance methods** (i.e. non-static methods), we have to call then through an object. So, in BlueJ, we invoke the constructor of the class to create an object first:\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\nAfter invoking the constructor, we will find the object created in the object bench at the bottom BlueJ.\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\nWhen we right click on this object, we will see the instance methods:\n\n![enter image description here][4]\n\nAgain, since one of the instance methods is public and the other one is private, we can only see one method here.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to Module 03 and Module 05.\n\n:)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14401278231912245.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14401278771177697.png\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14401281362146854.png\n  [4]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14401284624376135.png

The remainder for **`4 % 7`** is **`4`** but NOT **`5`**, as **`4 = 7 x 0 + 4`**, where the **`4`** on the left hand side is the dividend, **`7`** is the divisor, **`0`** is the quotient and the **`4`** on the right hand side is the remainder.\n\nIn general we have this formula:\n\n> **`dividend = divisor x quotient + reminder`**\n\nNote that the sign of the reminder is always the same as that of the dividend in Java, so that we **will not** have something like:\n\n> **`4 = 7 x 1 + (-3)`**\n\nMoreover, the magnitude of the remainder is always less than the magnitude of the result.\n\nFor the details, you may refer to this section of the Java specification:\n\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.17.3\n\n:)

Thank you, but I am still confused!  According to that example, 10%2 returns 0, which makes sense to me.  Then it says 4%7 would return 4.  Isn't the remainder 5 in that case?  What am I missing?

These tasks require you to complete the missing parts of a program and you will only need to submit the missing parts instead of the whole program.\n\nAs an example, for the [Try it Yourself (T02)][2] task, the entire program will be something like:\n\n>     public class HelloWorld\n>     {\n>        public static void main(String[] args) {\n>\n>            System.out.println("hello world");\n>        }\n>     }\n\nHowever, you will only need to submit one line of code to the grader and press the **Check** button as the other lines are given:\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\n<hr />\n\nHere are some kind reminders for coding assessments:\n\n1. Read the instructions carefully\n2. Test the code in BlueJ (the programming environment) before submission.\n3. You only have a limited number of times for submitting each exercise. The number of submissions can be found below the submission box.\n4. Make sure that you are only submitting the required lines of code.\n5. Feedbacks will be provided on the same page after submission. Use them to correct the program in case it is not entirely correct.\n\n<hr />\n\nHope you will enjoy the course and please feel free to post any other question on the discussion forum. :)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14400435667416919.png\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/courseware/1ee4603833d742e698d27695d2aa25b5/9b124556f7c742e19509587940fd1100/2\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14400448095829084.png

That's a very good question!\n\nIn general, it is considered a good practice to use getters and setters to access private instance variables so that they will not be read/modified in an unintended way by other logical components of a program.\n\nThe original aim of the BankAccount demo project here is to demonstrate the creation of two different instance of the same class and the use of different constructors. But you are free to modify it so that it better follows the coding conventions. :)

% is the modulus operator in Java and it does not mean "percent".

The source code of the square apple program is removed by default as it involves some programming concepts to be introduced in the later part of the course and we do not wish to make the materials too overwhelming.\n\nTo run the Square Apple N program, you can refer to the video "Message From The Instructor" under Module 02 - Introduction (Link below). The execution instructions should start from **3:08** of the video.\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/courseware/db78e7f298c345f3af42589e06c470a2/56590e05f2ce4677bb5dd61a29a2a90a/1\n\n:)

1.In main class, it was declared as "String[] args". But it should be declared as "String args[]".\n2.Method dance is having a return type String, so it should return some string otherwise make it as       \n  void.\n3.There is no return type for cleanSlateProtocol method which causes an error.\n4.There should be a return type for setID().\n5.Type mismatch occurs while trying to assign a string to an integer.\n
559a2e6ab30d847c6f00104f
That's a very structured Error log by Sykor. Particularly, the one in method setID() trying to do a string + integer addition (subtle to catch!)\n\n 1.   I am beginner and I would like to know the difference between private and public methods / variables. Does it mean, if a method declared as private in say, class IronMan, it cannot be accessed at all by an instance (or object) of another class like:\n\n                  `public class NewMan`\n\n 2.    I saw in few other posts suggesting\n\n                    this.id = givenId;\nI couldn't follow this ... Request some knowledgeable insight to grasp this. Thanks\n

Perhaps the program may not get compiled even.\n\nIn the context of constructors as explained in the lecture videos, I have difficulty in understanding why do we need multiple constructors when the Class is supposed to be a single template for object creation / definition ?\n\nIn other words, do we expect the objects within a Class to vary so much in their fields or data that we need multiple constructors.\n\nAny kind explanation will enable me grasp this topic better and will be highly appreciated.\n\nRegards

The compiler will return an error because it cannot find the right constructors for the parameters given in this example.

Smartphone is a classic example of Abstraction where the underlying details of implementation are hidden from the user . We do just get the interface and enjoy the functionalities that are exposed by the smartphone. Also as someone in the thread mentioned about TV where we are not bothered about how the remote functions.There can be many layer of abstractions e.g. when we drive a car there is a synchronization between various components where each of those expose the functionalities and interface and hide the underlying data .

And what about a TV, since the TV was invented, everybody just know what the TV do but just the tech support and people with themes related know how it works exactly.\n\nThe TV have a lot of parts and from the very first one to the very last, had been evolved trying to improve technology like color, sound, conectivity and so on, now are Smart TV's and Apps for TV, streaming and a lot more. But at the end, the normal user do not understands how everything works to do that and do it fine.

For this start with the variables a and b in the main function.  \nMain.a = 4, Main.b = 5 \n\nAlso a new Scope1 object is created with its own variables, a and c.  \ns.a = 2, s.c = 1\nIt then calls function s.two and looks for its return to assign to b.  s.two has its own variables a and b, with the variables passed to it from the function call in main.\n\ntwo.a = 4, two.b = 5\n\nC isn't defined inside the function, so it goes up to the Scope1 object s.  It then calls function s.one and passes it the two variables it got that were passed from main, 4 and 5\n\none.a = 5, one.b = 4\n\nFunction s.one doesn't define c, but the first thing it does is change the value of s.c to be 2 times the value of the a it was passed from function two().  So s.c = 10.\n\nIt then assigns its local variable a to be 3 plus the local variable of b, which is 7, and increments the local variable b by one.  So we have\n\none.a = 7, one.b =5\n\nIt then prints those values, one.a, one.b, and s.c, and returns the value of one.b back to function two().  It then assigns that value to s.c, so s.c is now 5.  Two() then changes s.a to be the local value of a plus 1 which is 5.  It then prints the local values of a and b, and s.c, (4, 5, 5), and return the local a (4) to the main function.  \n\nThe main function then assigns that value to its local variable for b, which is now 4.  It then prints s.a, b, and s.c, which is 5, 4, 5.

I have a similar idea, but with the router, the router can find the best path to send a packet of data, but most poeple don't know how does it work, also when someone connects to a wireless access point, they didn't realize how their devices works in conjuntion with a devices such a wireless access point, most people just connect and surf the internet without notice: the protocols are used, the firmware(software) in the routers(hardware), I think the more visible part could be the aplications over the different operating systems.

Hi PSLLSP,\n\nThank you reporting the problem and posting a suggested solution. We have tried to modify the project according to the suggested solution and the audio files can be loaded successfully without exceptions. However, another problem was introduced: the Clip objects of the Java Sound API could not be closed after a sound is being played. After various efforts of testing, we found out that the problem is caused by the implementation of the Java Sound API in OpenJDK. **After switching to Oracle JDK, both the problems of loading the sound file and closing the clip are solved.** We still encountered some missing sounds when testing the problem through a virtual machine, so we reduced the shooting rate to easy the problem.\n\nThe animating football program is now updated. We would be grateful if you could try to run it on your ubuntu system and let us know if it is working without any problems.\n\n:)\n

Yes, the missing of the import statement causes the problem.\n\nIt is also nice that you have also tried to use type casting to calculate the correct result. However, the final result is not yet correct since the type casting is done on the result of the integer division (9 / 5) which is 1. So if celsius is 1.0, the calculated fahrenheit will be:\n\n>     1.0 * (float) (9/5) + 32\n>     1.0 * (float) (1) + 32\n>     1.0 * 1.0f + 32\n>     1.0 * 32\n>     33.0\n\nOne way of fixing it is to make the type casting on 9 or 5 directly. Could you figure out another way to obtain the correct result?\n\n:)

The statement can be understood by a human and it depends of the situation, to have a well-defined problem, which one of its requirements is to have a finite number of solutions, I think I would have to convert the situations to a finite number of variables, each one with their respective values, and conditions. The problem could be stated better if it was What is the best way yo go from Hong Kong to London?, but it can be better if the problem take some variables and conditions, i.e. cllimate(values: it's ok to travel, it's not ok to travel), mean of transport (by plane, by train, by car, on foot), amount of money to afford the travel (enough to go by plane, enough to go just by train, enough to go by car, I can't afford any mean so I travel on foot), how fast I want to arrive London (the fastest, the slowest but secure (this can be tricky)); also conditions, i.e. I will travel by plane, if the climate is ok, I can afford a travel by plane and I want the fastest way. In other words, I think the well-defined problem depends of the number of variables(situations) and how they are combined (example: conditions) to have a finite number of available solutions. Please send feedback. Regards.

I believe it is not a well defined question. According to the definition of a well-defined problem a solution can be determined in a finite number of steps. The question is missing additional information that is needed to reach a solution. To come up with a solution, you need more information on the locations and what method traveling by.

HI **billkalarness**\n\n\nplease, refer to the documentation provided for comp102x's library,....**IO.class API**\n\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n*  http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/index.html\n\n\n\nAs you can see "**.output ( java.lang.Object  value)**" is typed "**void**", which means that invoking this method is **NOT** returning any value (String, Double, Integer, object,...), but it is used to print out "something" in the BJ's terminal.\n\nso, you cannot use the syntax \n\n<s>int value = </s>IO.output("hello");\n\ngetting an error "**incompatible types: void cannot be converted to int**", because IO.output("hello") does not return any value (int) to be stored.\n\nplease also read the previous Leofan's post, there you can find the correct syntaxis to [**01**] print out something in the BJ's terminal,... [**02**] and archive a value introduced by a user by typing in the BJ's terminal using for example a method "**.inputInteger()**", this method return a value ( an integer ) so can be stored into a variable.\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14395481981734018.png

we can use plug & play devices for example (aux cables which we can use in our cars to play music on). I recently installed cruise control in my car, I found out that I just have to buy a handle that fits and its on. Its amazing how the car recognized it like it was always there. No additional installations were needed. The same thing about aux, which ever player you want to use to play music, you can plug it and play it via aux cables.

This problem as written is not a well-defined problem. Even given a clear definition of "best way to travel", the conditions which the solution is dependent on is constantly changing and thus the solution is always changing an infinite number of times. This requires an infinite amount of steps to always give the correct solution; therefore, the problem is not well-defined.

Are you referring to Module 03 Graded Problem Task 2? One possible source of this error is that you are placing this line of code inside another method, e.g.\n\n>     import comp102x.Canvas;\n>     import comp102x.ColorImage;\n>     \n>     public class Test {\n>     \n>         private Canvas canvas = new Canvas();\n>         private ColorImage image1 = new ColorImage();\n>     \n>         public void f() {\n>             public ColorImage(){ canvas.add(image1,0,0); }\n>         }\n>     }\n\nAlso the line of code:\n\n> public ColorImage(){ canvas.add(image1,0,0); }\n\nis actually a definition of the ColorImage default constructor. To add an image to a canvas, you just need:\n\n> canvas.add(image1,0,0);

This would not be a well defined problem because what is considered good for an individual does not always agree with what is considered the common good. Personally, I have never been to Asia so chances are I would take many stops along the way in order to see as much as possible before returning to London trying to spend the least amount possible. A business man on the other hand may want to take the quickest flight with the most comfortable first class seats possible. Neither of these needs with be able to be might if both the persons where to end up on the same flight since the needs are conflicted.

Thank you for the answer but I was asking something else. See, when I declared ColorImage variable choiceImage inside If statement, the error occurred. But when I declared it outside the If-statement, it worked without any errors. In other words, Is there any difference between:\n\n1 . If( . .)\n   int a = 10;\n   \nand \n\n 2 . int a;\n   if( . . )\n   a = 10;\n\n\nI am having an educated guess that we cannot declare any variable inside if because when a variable is declared some memory space is allocated to it and in case of IF, we are not sure whether the body will run or not. This is the only explanation I could think of. Correct me if I am wrong.

I think the best example of data abstraction is the human body which we all are blessed with but actually don't know how it works and coordinates with different parts of the body at the same time. We are very much interested in it's functions like eyes for watching, legs for movement, nose for smelling, ears for hearing etc., but how it actually performs this functions are hidden somewhere with in us. We are the users which simply use the things in our daily life example, camera, torch, laptop, mobile, dishwasher, television, house, car, fan, light without actually knowing the mechanism behind its implementation.

> return statement is the point where the compiler will return some\n> value to the main code\n\nReturn type means, the type of data, a function can return. \n\n   \n\n     int instanceMethod()\n     {\n          int i=0;\n          //Method code;\n          return i;\n     }\nThis method will return an integer value. You can return any kind of data (defined in Java). From primitive data types (int,long,float...) to type wrappers (Character,Integer,Float...). Oh wait, you can also return objects ! and array references !\n\nP.S. The reference books mentioned gives a clear idea of return statements.

No, this problem is not well defined because we don't know what is meant 'best way' .... best way can be the one with shortest time or the one with cheapest cost or it can be the one which is fulfilled by shortest distance....it completely depends on the user or we cay say the client in this case...
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
another example of abstraction is like while driving we know that there is one break to stop the car and an accelerator to speed it up...we do not know or say don't want to know how they do their work...

To understand how the add() method produce the third image, we will have to understand pixel manipulation on images. Basically, a pixel on the new image is create by adding up the pixels from the two input images with clipping. This involves concepts that are not the main focus of this course. But if you are interested, you can refer to:\n\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_space\n2. http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/pixadd.htm\n\n**static members** of a class should be covered in Module 05. However, we can actually use the add() **instance method** to produce the third image.\n\nYou can refer to [this tutorial][1] for a more in depth explanation on class members with different modifiers.\n\n:)\n\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html

Wow!!  I am totally confused by this conversation.  \n\nI, too, wonder how an object is created by the add() function.  The 2 parameters for the add are both objects.  So yes we create a 3rd object, but it is a combination of the 2 objects given.  How does that give us the 3rd image that is supposed to be displayed?\n\nIf I am not mistaken, the subject of 'static' has not yet been presented, so short of doing research on the ramifications of 'static', I don't see what it implies.\n\nCan a little more detail be given?\n

Hello, my response is:\n\nOne: 7,5,10 \n\nTwo: 4,5,5\n\nMain: 5,4,5\n\nIt is important to know where we are located in the code. When we started with method Main, we are located within the curly brackets from line 26 to 34.\n\nLine 32 calls method Two, this is where block off method Main and we are in the block of method Two; within the curly brackets of the line 18 to 24. Likewise, method Two   calls method One on line 20.\n\nUnder the rules of scope, local variables have priority, if there is no local variable with the name written in the method block, Java then searches for that name outside the method block; if we are in a method block then will search in the instances block, and  changes instances variables value; if does not exist that name in block method or the block instance variables then there will be a compile error.\n

i can give an answer for that problem if don't see the structure of your code,....\n\nit's seems your code do not store the correct value into the variable "z" for each condition,.... ( [**01**] revise again all conditional statements, [**02**] make sure you are using "z = +1" and not "z += 1"  )\n\n\nyou could return the correct value directly without storing it in "z"\n\n>     if () { return ...;}\n>     ....\n>     else { return ...; }

This is not a well defined problem because the we don't know what that word "best" depicts. Whether it could be a fastest way to travel or it may be cheapest way to travel or can be anything that depends upon the argument revolving around.

An example of abstraction is a video game system like an XBox One. In order to hook one up to a television what wires go where and how to connect it to your internet then how to set the system up to your liking or your playing standards in order to play the games, connect with other players and play with them online.

Hello everyone my name is Toccara. I live in Atlanta, GA. I'm a 33 yrs old mother of two.I have an 8 month old son and a 17 yr old daughter. I'm taking this class because I been trying to teach myself Java but I needed a little help so that I'll know what I'm doing when I really do start programming because I want to use this knowledge to start my own business venture and I don't want my business venture to fail because I didn't learn, listen, and don't understand how to program in Java, learn coding in Java, or miss some important information that I needed to learn for Java which made it to hard on my company to make money in order to support the company which made it fail and have to close, which made financial difficulties on my family.

It's true the best way does have a lot of different meanings to everyone which for   a computer to put it in a program it would need specific in, but also what makes it not a well-defined problem is because the problem don't specify exactly where the locations in Hong Kong and London that you're leaving from and going to so just saying London could mean London UK, or London USA. Also it doesn't specify if there is a specific time that you have to be there by. The problem just has a lot of missing information for it to be a well-defined problem.

There are still some tiny problem here, but nice try! :)\n\nAllow me to point out that the correct spelling of "dgree" and "fehrenheit" should be "degree" and "fahrenheit" respectively. On the other hand, the last line of code:\n\n> `IO.outputIn( ... );`\n\nshould be:\n\n> `IO.outputln( ... );`\n\nwhere the second last character is a **small letter `L`** instead of a **capital letter `I`**. This is because **`outputln`** stands for output and move to the next **line**.\n\nOnce more issue is that if we input **1.0** to the program now, the output is **33.0** where the correct output should be **33.8**. Do you know how to correct this one? :)
55c255e4b30d8400020029b2
Could you tell us what problem are you facing in lab 5? It would be helpful if you could post any error messages you are encountering or write down your implementation in steps. Tell us the output/effect of the steps which are different from your expectation will also be useful. You can also post a small segment of code if that will help explaining the problem better, but please avoid posting the entire code. :)

we have got an internal discussion about how to solve this task [LAB 03 GRADED TASK 4 and sam for TASK 3 ], and we were agree that there are several options to pass the gradder in differents ways\n\nTo create a ColorImage.class 's object we must use the default constructor\n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/ColorImage.html#ColorImage()\n\n> **ColorImage**\n> public ColorImage()\n> \n> Constructs a ColorImage object by **loading an image from the file\n> system** and re-scales it to fit the default canvas size.\n\nthat will open a window to select a file from the system by the user...\n\nso we use that default constructor again to create first and second images...\n\n***[01] option "a" & "b"*** \n\nnow we can invoke at the same constructor to create the third image,... same procedure ( but in this case does not matter will image we select from the computer when the windoos ask for it,... because it will be redrawn when we invoke myltiply()'s method, so the previous picture loaded is deleted  )\n\n\n* http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/ColorImage.html#multiply(comp102x.ColorImage, comp102x.ColorImage)\n\n> **multiply**\n> \n> public static ColorImage multiply ( ColorImage image1, ColorImage\n> image2 )\n> \n> Multiplies two ColorImage objects together.\n> \n> Parameters:\n> \n> image1 - The first ColorImage object to multiply.\n> \n> image2 - The second ColorImage object to multiply.\n> \n> **Returns:**\n> \n> **A new ColorImage representing the multiplication result.**\n\n\n\n\nas we can see **multiply()** is a public method ( can be invoke outside the class ), is also declared as static ( so you do not have to create an ColorImage.class's object before invoking ) and **return an object of its class.**\n\ni will give you some examples of how to invoke a static method :\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\nlastly, that object created can be added into the canvas. **add()**\n\nrevise this thread :\n\n* https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m3a/threads/55bb16d1b30d846a8600253c\n\n\n***[02] option "c"***\n\nThis option is the **most efficient**, avoiding to create a third ColorImage.class's object ( option "a" & "b"), this solution will not ask for another user's input, and will be added directly into the canvas.\n\nbecause **multiply()**'s method returns an ColorImage's object, can be invoked into the **add()** method,  decribed in Canvas.class  \n\n    \n\n> canvas.add( ColorImage.multiply( image_01 , image_02 ) , ... , ... );\n\n\nrevise also this thread :\n\n*lab3 object declaration*\n\n* https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m3c/threads/55b7612cb30d84e33a001689\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14387838708188565.png\n

There are two main points:\n\n1. We should be doing the comparison using the int variable, **type**, of this choice and another choice. If we compare a choice with an int directly, (e.g. this == 0), Java will report an error, saying that Choice and int are incompatible types.\n<br />\n<br />\n\n2. Not all the execution paths returns a value. From the code fragment, the code first check whether another choice is a rock (0), paper (1) or scissors (2) using if-statements. However, Java does not know that a choice can only take values of 0, 1 or 2. So, it is expecting the code to return a value when choice is neither 0, 1 or 2 and when the code doesn't, it complains a return statement is missing.

No, it's not a well defined problem.\nThere are too many variables that have to be taken into account which then provide a myriad of solutions to the problem.\n

Household plumbing:  We know that turning on a faucet should give us water, and that we could have a lot or a little and cold or hot, without concern for how it is treated, delivered to the house, and heated.

I been trying to teach myself Java and the book that I started off with that really seem to help me to understand as a novice programmer to programming and coding are: \n\n 1. Java Programming for the Absolute Beginner By Joseph P. Russell (Which comes with a CD that has source code for all games included with the book if you buy it new.)\n       \n 2. Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies By Barry Burd (Which comes with free etips at dummies.com.)\n       \n 3. Introduction To Java Programming Comprehensive Version Ninth Edition By Y. Daniel Liang                                          \n(Which this book can be found on the internet for free if you google it and it's a pretty large book but very helpful if you need to learn how to do something new to you in Java or just need to remember something that you forgot how to do just as a reference.)\n.\n\nThese books were very helpful to me but i also used YouTube to help the main one that I used was this:\n\n       \n 1. LearnJava:Learn To Program In Java By Michael Fudge (This has 21 video's but this guy is a great teacher he goes at a good pace not too slow but not too fast either like in the middle so, you can work along beside him while he's teaching you how to do it, only thing is that you have to download the IDE NetBean IDE in order to follow alongside of this video.)\n           \n 2. Beginner Java Programming: Introduction To Game Design By Cross Coast Gaming (Which is done in a good mid-size pace for beginners like us. It has 24 video's in the subscription.Only thing is that you have to download the IDE NetBean IDE in order to follow alongside of this video.)\n           \n 3. Java Programming - Step By Step Tutorial By Patrick Washington DC (Which this video's pace is much slower than the other two video's that I gave you but it's still a good video at giving you the information that you need to learn in a much slower pace if you need a much slower pace and that's okay it just depends on how you as a person learn that determines how much slower/faster you need the video, because some of us learn much slower than others,while some of us learn much faster than others depending upon, the subject and the person,and amongst other things. It has 24 video's in the subscription.)\n    \nFor more advanced users or faster learner that need a faster pace then this video should be better:  \n    \n  4. Java Programming: Learn Java In 30 Minutes By Derek Banas (Which is at a very fast pace  and make it very hard for very beginners to keep up with the person teaching it unless you already somewhat know how to program and are at an intermediate level than this video is taught at a very fast pace and in my opinion is not for beginners that are just now learning Java for the first time.) These are all great resource tools for a beginner that's trying to learn Java to\nuse while taking an online course that just to get all the extra supplies or resources that they could get for the the class because that's what I'm doing also just to make sure I pass the class, and get everything out of the class that I can get.\n\n\n

We observe data abstraction in almost all the appliances around us. For instance, When we switch 'on' a ceiling fan, it starts to rotate and when we switch it 'off' it stops. We know it will work when we switch it 'on' but we don't know how the motor, which is responsible for the rotation, works.

I believe your post is related to the abstraction discussion of module 01.\n\nThe Point of Sale (POS) System in supermarkets is a good example of abstraction. The checkout staff will only need to focus on the product information displayed by the system. The details of how this information is stored and how are they retrieved by the system is hidden from the staff.\n\nYou may also check out the other suggestions from your fellow learners in the following post:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-m1c/threads/559a2bd3b30d84995600104e\n\n:)

The **swapCards()** methods is declared to be **private**. As oppose to public methods, private methods are for internal use only and are not supposed to be invoked through an instance. That's why the swapCards() method is not shown in an instance.\n\nIn fact, the **swapCards()** method, is invoked internally in the GameBoard constructor for randomizing the card positions when the game is created. So an indirect method for testing the **swapCards()** method is to create the game a few times and inspect if the cards are ordered differently in each creation. To do this, you will have to change the GameBoard constructor a bit to flip all cards facing up first. To be specific, modify the body of the first for loop in the GameBoard constructor to:\n\n>     cards[i] = new Card(i % (MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS/2) + 1);\n>     cards[i].setFacingUp(true);\n\nAfter that, just invoke the main method of the MatchingGame class to create the game several times for testing.\n\nP.S. Don't forget to revert the changes in the GameBoard constructor after  testing for playing the game normally. :)

To add a bit more, the method must return a boolean value in all of its possible execution paths. Certainly, if the body of the for loop is executed, a value of **true** or **false** will be returned. However, **what if the for loop is never executed?** The Java compiler is unaware of the value of **NUMBER_OF_CARDS** during compilation and it has no idea whether the for loop will always be executed or not.\n\nAnother thing for you to consider is that currently, you code does the following:\n\nCheck each of the cards, starting from the head of the array. If the card we are checking is flipped up, we say that all matches are found. Otherwise, we say that NOT all matches are found.\n\n**What happens if only the first card in the array is flipped up and all the others are not flipped up?**\n\n\n\n

In my opinion the bug that I presume to exist are the below:\n\nLine:17\nBug:A compiler error would be invoke that the "public void IronMask" method uses the name of constructor\nBug fix: In order to define a construction method with one String parameter, we have to delete "void" form the line.\n\nLine:21\nBug:We defined the dance method to return a String type value but in the body of the method we don't return anything, we just print a message to the screen\nBug fix:Change the return type in the definition of the method from "String" to "void"\n\nLine:25\nBug:In the cleanSlateProtocol method we haven't define a return type\nBug fix:Because this method doesn't actually return anything, it only prints a message to the console, we have to define the return type ofn the method as "void" (public void cleanSlateProtocol).\n\nLine:29\nBug:Same as in line 25\nBug fix:Define the return type of the method as "void" (public void setID)\n\nLine:29\nBug:In the definition of the method the parameter the type is int.But in the body of method we try to assign the int parameter to the id filed of the class which is of String type.\nBug fix:We must change the parameter "givenID" type from int to String.\n\nLine:33\nBug: We defined the method not to return a value but we actually return a String type value\nBug fix:Change the return type of method from "void" to "String".

A compiler error would be invoked because we haven't define a construction method\nusing as arguments two double type variables.Instead we have defined two construction methods using as arguments two variables, one of double type and the other of integer type.

I understood that and have resolved that problem. But to write the further code is becoming a problem. for eg:\n\nCanvas canvas = new Canvas(int width, int height)\nit gives error stating .class required.\n\nNone of the examples we have learnt till now shows how to solve such issues. Being a beginner, it becomes a problem to solve these syntax errors even though you know the logic. Please help.

List of found problems with the code of class `IronMan`.\n\n 1. The method `IronMan` starting in line is either a constructor and should have the return type removed from its definition, or it is a method with missing return statement and a badly chosen method name matching constructor-names.\n 2. The method dance declares String as a return type. But a return statement is missing. Return a value of type `String` or change the type of the return type from `String` to `void`.\n 3. The method `cleanSlateProtocol` is without a declaration of a return type. Add a return type of `void`. The same problem applies to method `setID`.\n 4. The method `getName` should have return type changed from `void` to `String`.\n 5. There is no constructor suitable for variable `mark42`. Create a constructor that takes a `String` as input parameter. \n\n

The declaration of q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0) does not match any constructor. A match would cause one of the double values to be implicitly converted to an int-type value. But a double can not implicitly be converted to an integer because of loss of accuracy. The compiler will produce an error.  \n\nThe declaration of q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10) could match constructor `Week3Quiz(int i, double d)` because the first argument of the constructor invocation matched required type of an integer. The second parameter would match by an implicit conversion of the variable from type int to type double. But a similar argument can be used to show that the other constructor also fits the variable declaration. The compile will fail due to ambiguity.

In case of the first instance of the class q3, I think that the compiler will take the first parameter, for example 10.0 and will use the constructar that use a parameter double, in this case the second constructor, and with the second parameter will truncate the value (from 10.0 to 10). In a similar way with the second instance of the class q4.\nIs that or an Error because the value types not correspond to the values of the parameters constructor.

Actually BlueJ is expecting a Canvas instance in the first textbox.\n\nSince the Player class and the Computer class has already been implemented correctly to invoke this draw method of the Choice class, you will not need to invoke it directly.\n\nIf you wish to test your implementation of the draw method, you can invoke the testCase1() method of the Lab04GradedTask2 class.\n\nStill, if you wish to play with it, you can input:\n\n> new comp102x.Canvas()\n\nin the textbox which invokes the constructor of the Canvas class to create a new Canvas instance using it fully qualified name. The fully qualified name has to be used here as the input interface does not allow import statements.
55b91fc2a9a36e4e4e0023ec
First, I would like to point out that the **compareWith()** method is a method of the **Choice** class. So it should be invoked through a **Choice** instance but not an integer. This explains the error message you encountered.\n\nTo explain when we are referring to the current choice and when we are referring to another choice, let's look at an example.\n\nSuppose we have the following simplified **Choice** class:\n\n>     public class Choice\n>     {\n>         private int type;\n>         \n>         public Choice(int value) {\n>             type = value;\n>         }\n>         \n>         public int getType() {\n>             return type;\n>         }\n>         \n>         public void compareWith(Choice anotherChoice) {\n>         \n>             String msg1 = "current type: " + this.type;\n>             String msg2 = "another type: " + anotherChoice.getType();\n>             \n>             System.out.println(msg1);\n>             System.out.println(msg2);\n>         }\n>     }\n\nWhen we invoke the following piece of code:\n\n>     Choice choice1 = new Choice(1);\n>     Choice choice2 = new Choice(2);\n>             \n>     System.out.println("Invoking compareWith from choice 1 ...");\n>     choice1.compareWith(choice2);\n>             \n>     System.out.println();\n>             \n>     System.out.println("Invoking compareWith from choice 2 ...");\n>     choice2.compareWith(choice1);\n\nThe output in the terminal windows is as follows:\n\n>     Invoking compareWith from choice 1 ...\n>     current type: 1\n>     another type: 2\n>     \n>     Invoking compareWith from choice 2 ...\n>     current type: 2\n>     another type: 1\n\nSo from this example, we can see that if we invoke the **compareWith()** method from the first choice, passing the second choice as argument, this.type refers to the type in the first choice and anotherChoice.getType() refers to the type in the second choice.\n\nSimilarly, if we invoke the **compareWith()** method from the second choice and pass the first choice as argument, we can expect the output on the terminal to be reversed.\n\n**So we can see that current choice is the choice invoking the method and another choice is the choice being passed as argument.**

Any kitchen appliance: we see the switches or buttons, and they may have a picture or symbol of what it does.  But we don't really know what happens when we turn it on.  One dishwasher may have a completely different way of making the dishes clean, but all we know is that we selected Pots & Pans and switched the lever, and voila - clean dishes.

dance method is private can not be accessed from outside the class.\n\ncleanSlateProtocol method doesn't have a return type.\n\nsetID doesn't have a return type.\n\ngetName shouldn't return void since it will return a string.\n\nThere is no default constructor for no arguments case in IronMan class.\n\nsetID shouldn't have a int argument, since id is a string.

First. I believe that the constructor must be declare before methods.\n       - Methods structure of line 17 and 21 must be write after Constructor structure  in line 25.\n      \nSecond. In line 21 the method output type MUST be avoid and not String, because there isn´t the Java keyword return in the body method.\n\nThird. In line 26 must be write the variable assignment wrote (initialize Variable id) in line 18 because is a constructor and in line 18 must be write the method IO.ouputln wrote in line 26\n\nFourth. Variable Initialization in line 30 will bug because variable id was declare in line 15 like String type; and in parameter list for setID constructor givenId variable is integer type.\n\nFifth. For the constructor's indentifiers in line 25 and 29 will bug because the constructor's names must be declare by using the name of the class  as indentifier (in this case constructors must be named  IronMan).\n\nSixth. In line 33 method output type MUST be String and not avoid, because the Java keyword return in line 36 this followed by a character string. And in line 36 "Mark "\n + id must be in brackets  ("Mark " + id).\n\nSeventh.  Line 42 will bug because no exist IronMan constructor \n          Line 43 variable name is not declare at the beginning in the variable declaration section. And a IronMan library was not declare at first code lines.\n\nEighth.  Line 47 will bug because no exist IronMan constructor \n         Line 48,49 and 50 will bug because a mark42 library was not declar at first code lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n

Still i am having one doubt that how is this happening that when i write this.type it returns current choice and when i type anotherChoice.getType() we get the value of anotherChoice as the method getType returns the value of type, how is it differentiated that whether it is current choice or anotherChoice.

For other details of the certificates, you may refer to certificates & credits section in the link below:\n\nhttps://www.edx.org/about/student-faq\n\n<hr />\n\n**[EDITED]**\n\nWe are happy to announce that on-demand certificates are now available. A **Request Certificate** button will appear in the [Progress][1] page once you achieved 60% or above and you can click on it to generate your certificate.\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/progress\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14404682624860645.png

Basically, for Lab 04 Graded Task 1, we are completing the implementation of a **instance method** of the **Choice** class, **compareWith()**, that allows a choice instance to **compare itself with another choice instance**. The rules for comparison is as follows:\n\n 1. If the choice instance itself beats the other choice instance, the\n    method should return 1.\n\n 2. If the choice instance itself is beaten by the other choice\n    instance, the method should return -1.\n\n 3. If the choice instance cannot beat the other choice instance nor is\n    beaten by the other choice instance, the method should return 0.\n\nTo determine which choice instance beats the other, we check the int variable **type** of the choice instances:\n\n - 0 represents rock\n - 1 represents paper\n - 2 represents scissors\n\nSo how do we refer to the variable, **type**, of the choice instance itself and  that of the other instance? To refer to a variable (or in general, a member) of the instance itself, we use the keyword, **this**. So in the body of the compareWith() method, we would type:\n\n> this.type\n\nwhen referring to the **type** variable of the choice instance itself.\n\nTo refer to the type variable of the other instance, we use accessor methods, which usually starts with the name **getXXX()**. For example, if we wish to refer to the type variable in the **anotherChoice** Choice instance, we would type:\n\n> anotherChoice.getType()\n\nTo speed up your implementation, you can refer to the nice and concise table posted by Ricardo above, which lists out all the possibilities of the comparison. You may regard the first column as the values of **type** of the choice instance itself and the second column as the values of **type** of the other choice instance.\n\nHappy Learning Java :)

We will get an error during the compilation because none of the constructors takes parameters of type "double, double" or "int, int". Conclusion it won't work.

The only thing that we pay attention to is when we touch something in a screen their job is to take us where we want, but many people don't think about what that do it or how did we get there by just touching a screen.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
I won't be compiled. Surely an error will appear saying that there aren't any constructor that match with the argument variables double double which it's trying to construct.
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
Probably we will have an error since there is no constructor to deal with the two double values.

As per what i understood by your explanation is that :-\n\n    public class ColorImage    \n    extends CanvasObject\n\nIf we define class is above way then every object of class ColorImage is also an object of class CanavsObject .But in lab 3 task we didn't use "extends CanvasObject" but still using ColorImage class object as parameter of method canvas.add which is of different class.\n\n

I knew from my faculty of Engineering in Egypt that these courses with low cost for a verified certificate have an importance to have a programming language only but you dont have to pay for a certificate because you will write in your CV that I have Java as a programming language and the company will make several exams and discussion to make sure that you have a good experience in it .... and that high cost certificate courses (3000 L.E - 500 Dollar ) is required...... Is that right?

The IO class in the comp102x package is not part of the standard java classes, it is made for this course only. If you wish to use the comp102x.IO class in other IDEs, you will have to add **comp102x.jar** and other relevant libraries to the IDE's library directory and import the comp102x.IO class in your java code.\n\nThe libraries can be downloaded here:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/comp102x_libraries.zip\n\n:)

Asking what's "the best way to travel" is to vague and has to many variables. for example what mode of transportation are we using, cars, boats, planes, trains, or our own to legs? do we what to get there quickly, or is there an exact time that we have to arrive by? This is the kind of question is intuitive for humans but, a computer would need be told each and every aspect in precise detail in order to understand.\nComputers are the ultimate idiot savants.

Yes Evan, you are correct.\n\nAs stated in the Returns section of the add() method Javadoc:\n\n>     Returns:\n>     A new ColorImage object representing the addition result.\n\nSo basically what the add() method does is:\n\n1. Take a ColorImage as argument (or two if we are calling the static method).\n2. Perform some pixels calculation.\n3. Create a new ColorImage by **invoking the ColorImage constructor**, passing the calculation result as argument.\n4. Return the newly created ColorImage.\n\nThe above steps are basically the same for all image arithmetic methods.\n\n:)\n\n\n

Hi pnmmrudu,\n\nThe program was designed to read in a EAN-13 format barcode and convert it to a long value. If the input barcode is not of EAN-13 format or is blue or occluded, the program will not be likely to decode a value and will report an error.\n\nHere is a short reference for barcode formats:\n\nhttp://www.scandit.com/2011/11/04/types-of-barcodes-choosing-the-right-barcode-type-ean-upc-code128-itf-14-or-code39/\n\n:)

Actually, they perform the same job (printing the argument and move to a newline afterwards).\n\nThe difference is that when using println(), we code like the following:\n\n> System.out.println(*somevalue*);\n\nAnd when we using outputln(), we code like the following:\n\n> IO.outputln(*somevalue*);\n\nWe are trying to group most of the IO methods together in a single class so that it would be easier to use and remember. :)

Using calculators, the panel on the microwave and the buttons on the dash board of a car are examples of extraction. All you have to worry about is using the manual to get these to provide results. No one is concerned in knowing the actual processes, hardware and software engineering that makes the results possible.

Agree. I think this is a good introduction into the level or precision required in computer programming since computers would basically need all the required information to provide a definite output.

The question is, "Is the statement well defined?" and my answer is no. There is too much ambiguity for many reasons. First there needs to be clearly defined points (more like geographic coordinates) and the word "best" presents another problem. I note the latter because it does not take into account how to reach the different points (mode of transportation), weather conditions, budget or many other variables.

The object that the add() method returns is created using a constructor that is in the add() method's source code.\n\nThe add() source code may look something like this\n\n      public ColorImage add(ColorImage operand)\n      {\n        return new ColorImage(ArithmeticOperations.add(this.image, operand.image));\n      }\nThe return statement returns a ColorImage object it creates by calling a constructor. As you can see the "new" operator is there. "The new operator is followed by a call to a constructor, which initializes the new object."

I really don't understand the documentation for comp102x.io, are there examples on how to use it? I had to read around for other Java resources because what they are asking in this class is confusing, and what I came up with for a functioning program that yields the correct result is this:\n\n    import java.util.Scanner;\n\n\n    public class  MultInteger\n    {\n    public static void main(String[] args) \n    {\n        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\n        \n        System.out.print("Enter an integer, x: ");\n        int x = input.nextInt();\n        \n        System.out.print("Enter an integer, y: ");\n        int y = input.nextInt();\n        \n        int result = x * y;\n        \n        System.out.println("The result is: " + result);\n    }\n}\n\nAnd that makes sense to me and it works the way I think it should in BlueJ. But I don't know how to translate that with the comp102x.io import or the public static void multiply() method.

Before I was thinking in terms of methods not constructors so the constructor on line 17 is mostly correct but should not be declared as void since it returns a value.\n\nline 21 as is needs to return a value of type String as declared. This can be corrected by making the line read something like private String dance(String mustDance){}  This in turn requires the inside of the method to change so line 22 would be something like mustDance = "You must be joking +_+"; and a new line needs to be added. return mustDance; A better way to modify would be setting it as type void.\n\nLine 25 is missing a return type so setting it to type void would fix it. Also setting it to private will make it be only referenced as part of the constructor.\n\nSo many things wrong with line 29. The biggest is that it is never called and the entire method can be eliminated.\n\nLine 33 must have a return type String.\n\nLine 42 the object declaration for defaultIronMan must match the constructor format or a new constructor reading IronMan() must be created or defaultIronMan will have no meaning.\n\nLine 44 as written will print "This is: ?" if as mentioned above the proper constructor is referenced.\n\n\n\n\n

I think a calculator would be an interesting yet simple example. We use a calculator for almost any calculation whether large or small. They can even graph and solve complicated problems. Whats interesting is we do not bother with the hardware of the calculator or what goes on inside it. It is rather programmed to solve our large calculations.

**Code segment 1** - a[0] = 0, because no value was assigned to this item of the array.\n\n**Code segment 2** - the code wil print: 3234\n\n**Code segment 3** - there is an error, because the declaration of an array must use square brackets [].\n\n**Code segment 4** - 0123\n\n**Code segment 5** - there is an error when you declare the array with its values int and then uses double.

I think this is a well defined problem. Because we should consider the it as a realtime problem. So we should consider all the current situation only. Not the future situations or possibilities. So here, the question "Finding the best way to travel from hong kong to london" is well defined. And what you call a best way to travel? I think a way which is fast enough, comfortable enough and under budget is the best way.\n\n

Line 17 is the first one that jumps out at me. By convention constructor and method names always start with a lower case letter. Since IronMan is already defined as the class as well it will throw an error. naming it ironMan with a lower case i will fix it. Since a value for id is being defined the constructor should not be type void. \n\nLine 21 can be declared as void and does not need String anywhere. Also it should be public to be visible within the main method. Since no values are being passed it can be written as: public dance(){\n IO.outputln("You must be joking +_+};\n}        \n\nLine 42 is also affected by line 17. By calling the new object type  IronMan it becomes recursive to the class and will throw an error. Again naming the constructor ironMan and then creating a new object of type ironMan will fix this.\n\nLines 29 through are never referenced anywhere in the program and can be deleted.\n\nLine 33 should not be void because it returns a value. It can be rewritten as: public getName(String tempName) for example and then line 36 can be tempName = "Mark " + id; and a new line return tempName; can be added.\n \nGiven the String declaration in line 43 getName grabs the name before the id can be set to something other than a question mark so the output for line 44 would look like This is: Mark ? If you condense it and eliminate 44 then after the changes to line 47 line 48 will output This is Mark 42.\n\nAgain on line 47 mark42 should be assigned as follows assuming the constructor was changed to ironMan: ironMan mark42 = new ironMan("42"); id then gets assigned the string representation of 42.

hi,\n\ni) Yes, I am using an if-else loop here.\nFirst I check if the current object's type variable is 0,1 or 2 and  I do the following:\nColorImage choiceImage = new ColorImage("rock.png");//if type .. 0\n\nii) Yes, I am using those methods.After selecting the pic, the next statement is\n\nchoiceImage.setX(x);\n\nI did the same for setting values for y (using setY) and rotating the object(using rotation).\n\n\niii) ... \n    \n\n\nI do all the operations on the image + creating the canvas object outside the if-else loop.Would that be the cause of my error?\n\n*TAC : [i edited some parts]*

What ends up happening is that the new objects look for suitable constructors that match the data types being passed. (example: 2 double type numbers exist in the first object.) Since neither constructor is defined with 2 double variables or 2 int type variables an error is returned. Two ways of fixing this are creating 2 more constructors (or modifying the existing constructors) that match the data types being passed.\n

I think according to the question, it's not a well defined problem, because it hasn't restrictions and it doesn't have some specific requeriments. I think we have to define first "what is a better way" (better way for time, money, to visit more turistic places, etc) and then we can say its a well defined problem.

 I have a doubt in project of class car taught in module 3. As per my understandings constructor is called when the object is declared and an object is created using keyword "new". Howerver "new" keyword wasn't used in car class so how the object is created and furthermore how the constructor is called ???

This is an interesting problem. It does not specify what is travelling. We could think that what is travelling is not a person, but for instance light, or a molecule of oxygen or even a whale or an elephant. But even if it's a person we don't know the context. For instance if it's a science fiction writer and he is thinking about the best possible way to travel in the future we can imagine a portal which teleports a person instantly from one city to the other. We can also imagine time-travelling, since time is not specified. So to make a well defined problem we must specify as much information about the problem as we can.

I think like most says, depends on what the skills of the person and his way of looking at problems. In my experience I have seen how a program can contain more than 30 lines of instructions and the problem can be solved with only 6 lines of instructions. And besides, it is known as in the first example problem that can be seen in 2 ways to resolve, but really the right way to resolve it is to know which rules are the priorities that the language will follow. In Mexico there is a song that says: "Do not have to get there first but you need to know to get". .

Eclipse is a professional IDE that is being widely used in the software industry. It contains many useful features that helps on large scale software development. However, on the same time, since eclipse is such a powerful IDE, it contains a lot of complicated features which might hinder the a beginner's learning. Since this is an introductory course, we would like to focus more on understanding and writing programs correctly than developing programs in a short time. So, we recommend BlueJ, which is simple and easy to use. This is not a straight requirement thought, you can use more advanced IDEs if you are familiar with them. :)

As others have mentioned, this defined constructor has an error as well in the "void" return type - which should be removed.

Statement No 29 raises a compilation error since the function does not supply a return type.\nStatement No 36 raises a compilation error since the declaration of the function states it is returning void.\nStatement 44 will give the name as ? since the default constructor is invoked and the default value of id is ?\nStatement 47 raises a compilation error since there is no parameterized constructor that takes String as an argument.

for the statement  Week3Quiz q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0); the compiler will raise a compilation error since it does not locate any constructor with 2 arguments as double.\nThe next statement Week3Quiz q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10); will compile fine.

In my opinion, finding the best way is not well-defined problem. There would be a lot of opinion in order to decide what is best. Meaning, best for every people has different definition regarding their point of view. For example, for every parents, the best point of view in order to go from HK to London is the safest way. Mean threat-less. But, for each of backpackers, the best way to go to London is the cheapest one. \n\nBecause by the definition, well-defined problem is a problem which we know the problem very well, so finding the best way from HK to London is not a well-defined problem

I think that the level of abstraction is dependent on the responsibilities of the observer. Take an apartments air conditioner for example. The tenant only cares that it works, that it can be turned on/off, and that the temperature can be set. The landlord only cares if it is working or broken, but the superintendent cares about many more details. Such as weather the machine is properly charged with coolant, it is receiving power, the fan bearings are properly greased, etc.

You may find that public and private are [acces level modifiers][1]. The public constructor is accessible from classes in other packages. Private constructor is only accessible from same class.\n\nYou may wonder why there are some private constructors. For certain situations, we may want keep single instance of a class (e.g. Abc) in the whole application. i.e. Design Pattern - Singleton. At that moment, a static method for creating instance of class Abc will be needed.\n\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html

We have two troubles with the formulation of the problem. By one side, as the instructor said, there are more than one place called London, so you need clarification here, and by other side, "best way" is a really vague term, that obviously has a lot of mean for different people, so this is not a well defined problem

Instance methods must be invoke through an object and an object must be constructed through a constructor. In general, we cannot fill in the attributes of an object without first creating it. So we have to construct a new BankAccount object first by using a BankAccount constructor and then invoke the deposit() method to update the balance.\n\n:)

Hi there,\n\nSorry that I could not quite get what you are saying, but let me give you the basic work flow for lab 2 task 1.\n\nIn lab 2, we are asked to write a piece of code to ask the user to enter two numbers and output the product of these numbers. So basically, what we need to do is:\n\n1. Output a message to ask the user to enter the first number\n2. Read the first number from the user\n3. Output a message to ask the user to enter the second number\n4. Read the second number from the user\n5. Calculate the product of the two numbers\n6. Output a message showing the calculated product\n\nThe [CourseGrade program][1] should act as a good reference for Lab 2 Task 1. You may want to study it in details. Should you have further questions, just let us know. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015+type@asset+block/week_2_course_grade.zip

Sorry Alex, it is not quite possible for us to add submissions now. :(\n\nWe would advice you to try your code on BlueJ first before submitting it to the grader in future assessments.
55aed8fbb30d84bdd2001d5e
@AlexC2000, billkalarness\n\nMost probably, you are coding like the following:\n\n> int x = IO.output("please enter a number: ");\n\nNote that the IO.output() method is for printing on the screen only and it will not get any value from the user. That's why the return type for IO.output is **void**, which means **"nothing"**. When we try to assign **"nothing"** to an integer variable, the Java compiler will complain, saying that it doesn't know how to convert **"nothing"** to a number.\n\nIf we would like to get an integer from the user, we should use the method inputInteger() from the IO class. As an example, after executing the following piece of code:\n\n> int a = IO.inputInteger();\n\na flashing cursor should appear on the terminal window, waiting for the user's input.\n\nNote that the terminal window only pops up when there is an output to it. So we would have to open it manually by clicking **View -> Show Terminal** in BlueJ. Or the better convention is to output something on the console first, like the following:\n\n>     IO.output("please enter a number: ");\n>     int a = IO.inputInteger();\n\n\n

Nearly every item in our lives can be considered abstraction from the bed we sleep in to the items we cook our meals with. When you look closer at the items we user in our lives that we consider simple and useful you can see and consider the complexities that make them up and what it may take to make those items "simple".

Enclosing your character string within double quotes will automatically create a **new String object**; for example, String s = "this is a string";\n\n**Creating String's ojects via constructor*\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n**two ways to create a String's objects (via constructor or as a Literal )*\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\n\n* [**6.3 Receiving objects**][4]\n\n![enter image description here][5]\n\n\n\n**[01b]** ***String literal***\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_literal\n\n A string literal or anonymous string[1] is the representation of a string value within the source code of a computer program. Most often in modern languages this is a quoted sequence of characters (formally "bracketed delimiters"), as in **x = "foo", where "foo" is a string literal with value foo – the quotes are not part of the value,**...\n\n\n**[01c]** ***String.class***\n\n* http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#equals(java.lang.Object)\n\n The String class represents character strings. **All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class.**\nStrings are constant; their values cannot be changed after they are created. String buffers support mutable strings. Because String objects are immutable they can be shared. For example:\n\n     String str = "abc";\n \n is equivalent to:\n\n     char data[] = {'a', 'b', 'c'};\n     String str = new String(data);\n \n added :: String str = new String ("abc");\n\n\n**[02]** ***3.10.5. String Literals***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-3.html#jls-3.10.5\n\n A string literal is always of type String (§4.3.3).\n ..\n **A string literal is a reference to an instance of class String (§4.3.1, §4.3.3).**\n\n Moreover, **a string literal always refers to the same instance of class String**. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (§15.28) - are "interned" so as to **share unique instances**, using the method String.intern.\n\n![enter image description here][6]\n\n![enter image description here][7]\n\n\n**[03]** ***15.28. Constant Expressions***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.28\n\n- The equality operators == and != (§15.21)\n\n- **Compile-time constant expressions of type String are always "interned" so as to share unique instances, using the method String.intern.**\n\n\n\n**[04]** ***15.21.3. Reference Equality Operators == and !=***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.21\n\n ***While == may be used to compare references of type String, such an equality test determines whether or not the two operands refer to the same String object.*** \n\n![enter image description here][8] . ![enter image description here][9]\n\n\n  ***The result is false if the operands are distinct String objects, even if they contain the same sequence of characters (§3.10.5).*** \n\n![enter image description here][10]   .  ![enter image description here][11]\n\n\n\n ***The contents of two strings s and t can be tested for equality by the method invocation s.equals(t).***\n\n![enter image description here][12]\n\n\n**[05]** ***more examples***\n\n**Using same reference s0x=s0y*\n\n\n![enter image description here][13] . ![enter image description here][14]\n\n**Using "+" operator*\n\n![enter image description here][15] . ![enter image description here][16]\n\n##**LITERATURE**\n\n**[i]** ***Comparing Strings and Portions of Strings***\n\n* https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/comparestrings.html\n\n>     boolean equals(Object anObject)	\n>     Returns true if and only if the argument is a String object that represents the same sequence of characters as this object.\n\n**[ii]** ***How do I compare strings in Java?***\n\n* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java\n\n>      == tests for reference equality.\n>      .equals() tests for value equality.\n>\n>      Consequently, if you actually want to test whether two strings\n>      have the same value you should use .equals().\n\n**[iii]** ***How can I get the memory location of a object in java?***\n\n* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7060215/how-can-i-get-the-memory-location-of-a-object-in-java\n\n NO\n\n Without using JVM-specific features this cannot be done. Java deliberately hides the location associated with each object to give the implementation more flexibility (the JVM often moves objects around in memory when doing garbage collection) and to improve security (you can't use raw pointers to trash memory or access nonexistent objects).\n\n Remember that garbage collection may move the memory location of an object, so the hint given may give inaccurate information. You can get similar information with System#identityHashCode(java.lang.Object).\n\n\n**[iv]** ***for advanced users....***\n\n* https://youtu.be/W8nNdNZ40EQ\n\n Lecture 14 | Programming Methodology (Stanford)\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1437575632844549.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375752621053105.png\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375735357855005.png\n  [4]: http://www.bluej.org/tutorial/tutorial-201.pdf\n  [5]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375742645042345.png\n  [6]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375750092099385.png\n  [7]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375747201449655.png\n  [8]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375766663590503.png\n  [9]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1437576676631789.png\n  [10]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375762404781876.png\n  [11]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375764789606849.png\n  [12]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375773477269309.png\n  [13]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375785836066077.png\n  [14]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375785541850485.png\n  [15]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14375790051884047.png\n  [16]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1437579517227348.png

An example of abstraction is touch screen on your tablet, phones or other mobile devices. The design is for the device to respond to the human touch. The design allows you to launch apps by touch the icon of the apps. The hardware used to create the devices is different from regardless of the touch screen feature.\n\nThe keyboard is also another example. We use it to input data like I am using to answer this forum. We are not concerned on how the computer translates our key strokes to letters on the screen but how it responds to our keystrokes.

A computer mouse is a good example of an abstraction.  All mice would need some kind of planar movement (two-dimensional) tracker, and at least two manually input parts (the mouse buttons) and it would not matter to the designer of the exterior of the mouse as to how the internal handlings of these inputs were done.  The innards of the mouse could change from a ball to a laser and neither the user nor the computer would be directly affected.

no it is not a well defined problem because a lot of things needed to be specified for example what do you mean by best way ( cheapest, comfortable or shortest , with less traffic etc ) like this all other things like location , mode of travle etc needs to be defined as well

Hello Alex,\n\nPlease try to install BlueJ 3.1.5. instead. As also reported by another fellow learners, BlueJ 3.1.5. works fine and should not report error messages during installation.\n\nReference:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-software/threads/559cc562a9a36eb14200130d

Hi Kallash, Welcome to the course! :)\n\nActually, for this course, you can use any IDE that you are comfortable with. The demo programs and the assessment templates will mainly be provided in BlueJ, so you will have to rebuild them if you wish to work on a different IDE than BlueJ.\n\nMicrosoft Visual Studio 2013 should not support the Java language by default, but you could try the expansion for MSVS provided in the link below if you really wish to use MSVS.\n\nJava Language Support Expansion for MSVS:\nhttps://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/bc561769-36ff-4a40-9504-e266e8706f93\n\n

hi Zeyanbacker,\n\nerror code 2503 and 2502 is likely to be problems associated with **.msi** files. The following post should be useful in solving the problem:\n\nhttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/internal-error-25032502/28b361b7-b2d7-494d-8470-5969f6850f5a\n\nAfter solving this issue, you can proceed by following the nice suggestion by Ricardo above, either:\n\n1. Installed BlueJ bundled with JDK\n2. Install JDK and BlueJ separately\n\n:)

Let me try to explain to see if I understood, step by step:\n\n1 - {inside the main method} b = s.two(a, b) ==> b = s.two(4, 5).\n\n2 - {inside the method 'two'} c = one (b, a) ==>  c = (4, 5) [this is tricky!].\n\n3 - {inside the method 'one'} c = a [5, from the previous step] * 2 ==> **c = 10**.\n\n3.1 - a = 3 + b [4, IDEM] ==> a = 3+4 ==> **a = 7**.\n\n3.2 - b = b [4, IBIDEM] + 1 ==> **b = 5**.   =================== So, method 'one's values are **7,5,10.**\n\n4 - The method 'one' states that its return is 'b', so the **'c'** **within the method 'two'** is equal to **5**.\n\n4.1 - 'this.a' doesn't affect the real value of **'a'**, wich is given as **4**. I guess that if the output was stated that way it would be changed: *IO.outputln("Two: " + [this.]a + "," + b + "," + c);* then the value of 'a' would be 5, right?\n\n4.2 - The **'b' is given as 5**, as shown in the step 2. =========== Method 'two' abc are, then, **4,5,5**\n\n5 - I need help to understand the print in the main method.

It is not well-defined. Preferred means of transportation and economic and time-related limitations are two very important factors that would help determine which is the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London. Is the traveler a tourist or a businessman? Each one would have a different budget, schedule, and set of priorities. Since the answer would vary depending on the traveler's priorities and limitations, which are not mentioned in the question, the question is not well-defined.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
It is not well-defined. The traveler could be a tourist or a businessman. Each one would have a different set of priorities in mind.  Therefore, each one would also have a different definition of what "the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is.

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I don't think this is a well defined problem because along with the idea that the "best way" needs to be more specified, it is necessary to discuss where in London and Hong Kong we want to travel. For example, both Hong Kong and London are large cities, and to identify the fastest route (if that is what we are looking for), we have to choose an airport that is closest to our specific destination.

The word 'best' is a highly ambiguous term. It has so many different meanings for different people. There are various other constraints that further need to be specified before arriving at a meaningful answer to this question. Another ambiguity is contained in the the word 'London' as it does not specify the country in which that 'London' is there, as the instructor mentioned in the video. Clearly, the problem, in its present form, is not a well-defined one.

**Can I use the same name for an instance variable and parameter of a function ?**\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nIs it possible to have the same name for a parameter(of a member function) and an instance variable ? Yes of course. **It is completely legal to have name of parameter same as the name of an instance variable**. However when this happens, the parameter hides the instance variable. Thus even if you wanted to work on the instance variable, compiler will only consider the parameter. How to solve this problem ? Simple. Use "**this**" keyword. **this** keyword lets you refer directly to the instance variable. By using "**this**" you are telling the compiler that you are mentioning the instance variable.\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\n[Java Tutorials for this keyword][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1437399954210828.png\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/thiskey.html\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14374006258666424.png

Perhaps most of us can understand that "best" can be interpreted in various ways. Whether it is the cheapest, the fastest, the most comfortable ... etc. We can certainly give an answer by our own interpretation and there is no really right or wrong as it is subjective.\n\nHowever, if an ill-defined problem is posted to a computer, it will not be able to answer us as it doesn't know what we would like it to compute. For example, if we ask the computer to give us the best number in a collections of numbers, it will have no idea on how to find us the answer we want. Therefore, it is important for us to give clear and non-ambiguous instructions to the computer if we are to rely on it to solve problems. :)

For example, ideally in democracy, the government call for elections each defined amount of time, and suposing that differents political parties have the same goals (take care of the nation and citicens and make them grow up), and the system to change them is always the same, we can see this system as an abstraction.\nThe leaders are changing all over the time, but the goals, and the system to choose the government is maintained.

The problem of, "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is not a well defined problem. There are multiple things or variable to consider while answering this, your comprehension of the word "best", the basis or evidence you are using to establish the pricing, speed, or comfort of a form of travel. There are too many variable to consider for us to answer this problem the way the person asking wants us to.

Hello,\nI do not think that an error will be generated in order to execute\n\n    IO.outputln(q4.x);\n\nIn this case, I expect the Java compiler to cast, I mean, to automatically convert a value given as an int into a double. There will be no loss of information given that double includes all numbers represented by int.\n\nAs for:\n\n    IO.outputln(q3.x);\n\nI am less sure if there will be any automatic casting by the Java compiler because it is the inverse operation but I think that there will still be conversion from double numbers into int numbers even if this incurs a possible loss of information.\n\nSo, I do not think that an error will be generated in this case either.\n\nThat was just my 2.0-cent (equivalent to 2-cent) contribution.

A  concrete example of an abstract class would be a class called Animal. You see many animals in real life, but there are only kinds of animals. That is, you never look at something purple and furry and say "that is an animal and there is no more specific way of defining it". Instead, you see a dog or a cat or a pig... all animals. The point is, that you can never see an animal walking around that isn't more specifically something else (duck, pig, etc.). The Animal is the abstract class and Duck/Pig/Cat are all classes that derive from that base class. Animals might provide a function called "Age" that adds 1 year of life to the animals. It might also provide an abstract method called "IsDead" that, when called, will tell you if the animal has died. Since IsDead is abstract, each animal must implement it. So, a Cat might decide it is dead after it reaches 14 years of age, but a Duck might decide it dies after 5 years of age. The abstract class Animal provides the Age function to all classes that derive from it, but each of those classes has to implement IsDead on their own.

I think the problem's not really well defined problem. We should know first of all, what "best" means. The next step would be, be aware of the whole possibilities to achieve the goal "travel from Hong Kong to London", and whit this information make decissions depending on the state of others variables we can't manage, like weather, wars, etc..\n\nThat would be a possible algorithm to solve the problem: "find the best way to go from Hong Kong to London"\n\nThank You :)

well, for the moment do not uninstall JRE only uninstall BJ,..... the install the appropriate JDK version for your OS-64,... after that then only install BJ 3.1.4 program (7 mb),... let us know your results [ note : you must install everything as administrator ]\n\n\n*What is the difference between the JRE and the JDK ?*\n\nhttps://www.java.com/en/download/faq/techinfo.xml\n\n    \n\n> **JDK** : It includes the JRE, set of API classes, Java compiler ( javac ), Webstart\n> and additional files needed to write Java applets and applications.\n\n\n

Hi. I am Linh from Vietnam. I has been working as a banker in my country for 3 years. Lately, i am inspired by start up story and tech world. So i decide to learn about coding, begin with Java.\nI do hope to change my job to a developer/software engineer and work abroad or start a business online.\nThanks all the support from class. We are new family ;)

a is set to 4 than passed in via the call ;\nint a = 4; \nb = s.two (a, b);\n\nInside method 'two' this assignment\nthis.a = a + 1;\nmerely changes the private instance variable 'a', bit the passed in value.\nAs it remains the same, it is printed as 4.\n\nThis is an EXCELLENT reason never to overload names unless ABSOLUTELY necessary. The confusion created pretty much ensures bugs in the code and a maintenance nightmare.

**Array length**\n\n**Snippet**\n\n    int array[] = new int[10];\n    String string = "Test";\n    array.length(); // error.\n    string.length(); // Works fine\n\n\nIf you are new to Java, one of the common mistakes done is stated above. Here *length* is a **special attribute** that is attached with every array. Since *length* is not a method, so it completely makes sense that it will not work on objects. Hence if you need to find the length of strings, you need to use *length()*. Moreover *length()* is a method of class String.

That's a very good question! Actually, there are some subtle differences between constructors and methods.\n\nThere are 5 essential parts for a method declaration:\n\n1. Access modifier\n2. Return type\n3. Name\n4. Parameter list, and\n5. Body\n\nThe picture below labels the different parts of a method declaration:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nA constructor declaration is similar to a method declaration except the following two points:\n\n1. A constructor declaration **MUST NOT** have a return type, **not even void**.\n2. The name of the constructor **MUST** be the same as the name of the class.\n\nThe picture below labels the different parts of a constructor declaration (Assume that it is a constructor for the **Car** class):\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\nSo basically, we can differentiate a constructor from a method by looking at its name (whether it is the same as the class) and its absence of a return type. :)\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14371916261560449.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14371920214927722.png

A constructor has the same name of its class and no return type.

in double fahrenheit= Celsius*(9/5) =32;\nthere is logical error, coz it will produce (9/5) answer 1 rather than 1.80. this is the logical error, in line 5 there should be ";" rather than ",", and also celsius is declared not Celsius declared.

Dear MatheusAlmeida97,\n\nThank you for expressing your concern on Module 02 Graded Problem Task 3.\n\nIn Java, we will perform integer division when both operands of the division operator (/) are integers. When either operand is a floating point number, we will perform floating point division. For example the expression\n\n> 1 / 2\n\nwill be evaluated to 0.\n\nThe expressions\n\n>     1.0 / 2\n>     1 / 2.0\n>     1.0 / 2.0\n\nwill be evaluated to 0.5.\n\nBackslash (\\) may be used to perform integer division in other languages such as Octave ([Reference][1]). However, it is not considered as a valid operator in Java.\n\nOn the other hand the reminder operator (%) finds the reminder when **a** is divided by **b**. Given the dividend is 3 and the divisor is 4, the quotient is 0 and the reminder is 3 as given by the formula:\n\n> divisor x quotient + reminder = dividend\n\nWe are not sure of which program you are using to compile and run Java code. If you do not mind, could you give us more details on the program so that we can try to test it by ourselves?\n\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_%28mathematics%29
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Best way can be different for different peoples.We need to define more constraints to make it a well defined problem eg mode , time , comfort , cost , etc.....We also need to consider certain limitation in finding the solution.

This may be an "out of the ordinary" example, but how about us, the humanity.

hmm, actually you need two images, one for the left eye and the other for the right eye in order to create a stereo image. You can try to take photos of the same scene by a camera at slight different angles and load them into the program for creating stereo images.\n\nNevertheless, if you just have a single picture, you can create a copy of the picture and do some editing. After that, you can load the original picture and the new picture into the program to create a stereo image.\n\nThe 3D effect of the following image pair might not be good, but just for fun :)\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14371041233256859.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14371041376266784.png

I agree with many of the responses.  The question of "What is the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London?" is not a well defined problem. Words like "best" are not well defined.  Is the "best" the fastest or coolest?  Easiest or most challenging?

Coming from oil & gas industry, I must add pumping Gasoline in our gas tank is another classic example of abstraction. When we pull that lever, we expect the pump to start dispensing gasoline. Although we are not doing much while filling up the fuel tank, we seldom think about the technology and multiple bases this fuel had to through before it lands in our vehicle's fuel tank.

Hi there! The stereo images are made to be in grayscale so that the 3D effect would be more prominent when viewing with crudely made 3D glasses. After you have learned loops in Module 05, you will be equipped with all the necessary concepts to create stereo images with Colors.\n\nNote that SimpleStereoCreator program only works for images of the same size and with a slight deviation in position in the horizontal direction. The file format should not be a problem. If you don't mind, perhaps you can post the images you have in hand so that we can take a look? :)

The **setX()**, **setY()** and **setRotation()** methods are of the ColorImage class. They are used to set the **x**, **y** and **rotation** fields of a ColorImage which will be used when the ColorImage is being drawn on a Canvas.\n\nSo when we code:\n\n>     ColorImage image = new ColorImage("image.jpg");\n>     image.setX(100);\n>     Canvas canvas = new Canvas();\n>     canvas.add(image);\n\nThe ColorImage will be drawn at position (100, 0) [x, y] on the canvas where the top left hand corner is (0, 0). Note that the default values for  the **x**, **y** and **rotation** fields of the ColorImage are all 0, hence (100, 0) in the above example.\n\nIn this task, you will need to set all of the **x, y** and **rotation** fields of the ColorImage that you added to the Canvas.\n\nAlso note that the Canvas which you will be adding your ColorImage to, and the proper values of the x, y and rotation fields are already given as the arguments of the method.\n\n>     public void draw(Canvas canvas, int x, int y, int rotation) {\n>\n>        // Your Code Here\n>\n>     }\n\n**Redefining them leads to a compilation error.**

You go through the main entrace, through here a new scope1 and a is set to 4 and b is sent to 5. The next portion sends you to the second function while passing the parameters a. b. The first portion in this method is c which sends you to first function but a and b are flipped when passed into the first function. Here it takes b as a and vice verse it does the math. After finishing the math in the first function it prints out the math done. Then it goes to back to the second function does the math and prints it out. Next it goes back to main method and prints out what the code tells you to.   
559a3085b30d8463fc0011d9
b = s.two (a, b); sends you to the second method.Where c sends you to the first one but a and b are flipped beccause of how c passes the parameter to the firts method.

By definition a well-defined problem would give you all variables and aspects. For two reasons, the first so that you know exactly what you are getting yourself into and the second so that you know how to define "the best way." For me with travel, I look at two things, the speed in which I get to my destination and the price of the ticket, depending on my method of transportation. So the actual question for me would be what is the cheapest and fastest way to get from London to Hong Kong, but for some people it would be what is the fastest way to get from London to Hong Kong or what is the cheapest way to get from London to Hong Kong. This question is defined by the person asking the question as well as by the person answering the question. It is all a matter of perception.

According to the defintion of abstraction we have reviewed in the course there are many examples in every day life, most home appliances work like that, we use a blender or a microwave oven just pushing the buttons to obtain the results we need without thinking how it all is done.\n\nAnother example is when we want to withdraw some money from the ATM, we go there push the buttons follow instructions and get our money, we don't stop to think about how it was done.\n\nEven more at the time I was writing this answer I just pressed the correct keys to form a message that was understandable for you, however I was not paying attention to the internal process in the computer to print the letters on the screen.

I don't think it is a well defined problem, because the objective is not clear stated, the concept "the best way to get to somewhere" may differe based on the needs of who wants to get there, More constraints are necessary to determine what is meant with "the best way to get somewhere"

Ok. In the ColorImage demo, the instructor chooses a "helix left" image and a "helix right" image.  The titles of the files should not matter.  The images are combined on the canvas to form a 3D image.  While this works for the .png files with which we are provided, it does not work for .jpg files I have on hand.  The program is a lot less fun if all I can use are the images provided. \n\nDoes anyone know why this might be the case?  And, yes, I can get images on the canvas.  However, when I try to combine the images whose color has been adjusted, all I get is a black-and-white photo, not a 3D image.  I need to know why this is happening and how to fix this. Thx!

I think an error or a warning will occur as outcome, because none of the constructors match, the will try to output the initial x variable which is not initialize at all. 
559a2d4ea9a36e435300105f
Since, there's a mismatch between type of parameters and arguments passed to the constructors, the compiler will throw errors or warnings.

In this task, the description to the program is a claim only. The program might behave in a way different from the description (e.g. It just accepts any value and output correctly). So if we input a value in the range of 0 - 100 (e.g. 50) into the program and receives a correct output, we still don't have enough clues to say the claim is true.\n\nWhat other values would you input to the program to test if the claim is true? :)\n\n

An example of abstraction is a house. Houses are all different, and have many different parts. Even though houses can differ greatly, we all know what a house is. We don't really care how it is built as long as it works as a place where we can live. Also, if one part of a house is broken, like a door or something, the house will still be able to function the same way it did before.

That is what One might assume, but after having installed the Bundled Version,\nBlueJ was looking for the JDK.\nThe JDK was not "installed" in any sense.  Neither BlueJ nor Windows were aware of the existence of the JDK.\n\nAs it turns out, the JDK files were merely dumped into the Program Files/BlueJ/jdk folder which does not really constitute installation if even the installed application is not already configured to be ready to run, or at least know where to look for its bits and pieces.\n\nFurther, having figured that out, and successfully got BlueJ: Square Apple IDE session up and running, SquareApple appears as (no source)\n"This class cannot currently be parsed"\n\nNone of the tools enable any interaction with the class files which upon inspection look like some kind of ascii-fied byte-code beginning with cafe babe\n\nThis all seems very half-baked.

The best way might also change with the occurrence of calamity. cost,time,distance,weather,appropriate location are factors to be considered.

You can use **Java - The Complete Reference** (9th Ed) by Herbert Schildt which is a comprehensive edition that covers all the features in Java. But this book might need some basic insights of C and C++ and it is more of a reference book than a must read.\n\nYou can use one of these books\n\n - **Head First Java** By Kathy Sierra.   \n - **Thinking In Java** By Bruce Eckel.\n - **Java A Beginner's Guide** (6th Ed) By Herbert Schildt.\n - **Core Java, Volume I : Fundamentals**  (9th Ed) by Cay S Horstmann *(For Serious Readers and can continue **Core Java, Volume II : Advanced Features** (9th Ed) to go beyond basics)*\n\n**Java - The Complete Reference & Core Java** is very useful if you plan to go beyond the basics.

According to the definition provided in the previous video, this is a well defined problem because it has a "solution exists for the problem" and "the solution can be found in a finite number of steps".

An iron. All we care about is having it hot and regulating the heat so that we can iron our clothes. We don't focus much on what happens when we turn on the switch and all the associated connections that make it work that way.

Hi, between London and Hong Kong there are finite routes which connect the two cities, actually it is possible that there are infinite routes. This makes the problem not a well defined problem. The assumptions and the constraints we may use in this problem help us to define the problem and make it narrow for us to solve it easily. That's is when the idea of efficiency comes to play.

Yep great for pointing this out. Seeing as Java is a case sensitive language it pays to be extra attentive to what your typing / spelling :)

The qoutation marks are incorrect because single marks are used for single characters, while double are for two or more. "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/439485/is-there-a-difference-between-single-and-double-quotes-in-java" gives a good explanation

Fuel pump at a gas station. The abstraction of the functionality comes from pressing the button for the type of fuel, then pulling the trigger to expel the fuel out of the pump and into our car. We can't see the mechanics or where the fuel is coming from. But we can expect gasoline to pour out of the hose after pulling the trigger.

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think that this question is not a well-defined problem because there are so many different ways to understand this problem. For example, in London itself there are six airports and in Hong Kong there are two. There is even the possibility to walk from Hong Kong to London. Also, "Best Travel" can mean different things for different people, some may think "Best Travel" is the cheapest, some may think it is the quickest or even the most comfortable. Therefore, this problem is not well-defined.

When I saw your code you initiated width and height correctly but you never assigned a value to them later in the program. On the lines where you ask the user for input add\n\n    width = ask_for_input;\n    height = ask_for_input;\n\nreplace ask_for_input with the appropriate IO method.

A class can be declared private when it is nested. That is, the class exists within another class. A class is declared to be nested when it is only useful to its enclosing class. For example, in the module where we teach event-driven programming in part 2 of the course, event handler classes are sometimes declared to be nested classes.\n\nYou can read more about nested classes in the Oracle tutorial below. :)\n\n**Nested Classes**\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html

Hello,\n\nFrom the grader feedback, the dimensions of the canvas created is not correct. By default, a canvas of 800 x 600 is created when the default constructor (constructor with not arguments) is used to create a canvas. If we want to created a canvas of specific size, we need to use an argumented constructor to create the canvas.\n\nAccording to the [Javadoc of the Canvas class][1]:\n\n>     public Canvas(int width, int height)\n>\n>         Constructs and shows a canvas with specific width and height.\n>     \n>     Parameters:\n>\n>         width - The width of the canvas to be constructed.\n>         height - The height of the canvas to be constructed.\n\nWe can use the above the constructor to create the canvas where we can pass the specified width and height as the first and second arguments to the constructor.\n\nFor example, if we want to create a canvas with width 123 and height 456, we can code the following:\n\n> Canvas canvas = new Canvas(123, 456);\n\nYou may wish to experiment with the Canvas constructor before proceeding to the later tasks. :)\n\n  [1]: http://w02.hkvu.hk/edX/COMP102.1x/Javadoc/comp102x/comp102x/Canvas.html

From the error message, it is likely that the variable height is not declared properly. You may wish to check the spelling of the variable and whether you have used the correct syntax for declaration. The correct syntax for declaring a variable should be:\n\n> [Data Type] [Variable Name];\n\nFor example:\n\n> int myInteger;
55a323bfb30d849ac80015c7
When you ask the user for the width and height you need to assign the outputs to their variables.

The contents of the terminal windows is not cleared by default by BlueJ. So the "Hello, world!" probably comes from the first call to the method but not the current call to print the other string. If you wish to clear the terminal window at each time a method is called, you can try the following steps:\n\n1) Open the terminal window by clicking **View** -> **Show Terminal** in BlueJ.\n\n![][1]\n\n2) Check **Options** -> **Clear screen at method call** in the terminal window.\n\n![][2]\n\nHereafter, all the terminal window will be cleared for each method call.\n\nP.S. You can also clear the contents in the terminal windows manually by clicking **Options** -> **Clear** (or **Ctrl-K**) in the terminal window. :)\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14367569221723282.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14367571003359718.png

Instead of using x as a variable use variable rotationInRadians.\n\nYour expression must be like this\n\nrotationInRadians * Math.PI/ 180.0;\n\n
55a2bce4b30d84a7e500149e
Please try to make sure you have the variable **rotationInRadians** declared.\n\nYou might want to check the following things:\n\n1. The spelling of the variable.\n\n2. Whether you are using the correct syntax to declare it. A correction declaration should start with a type and then the variable name. e.g.\n\n> int variableName;\n\nYou may also use a printing statement to output the calculated value of **rotationInRadians** in BlueJ first to see if it is the output you expected. :)\n

This does not seem like a well defined problem since like everyone else said it does not specify first what "best" means. Second the constraints of what type of travel, like walking, plane, water, car? Additionally, it is very vague as there is no specific address, who knows what the start and end point is.

An example of abstraction could be the UI of your phone, where the phone symbol represents the phone, where each number corresponds to an input where you can actually put in a usable phone number. We do not care about what kind of programming went into it or how the voice data gets transmitted, just that it works and we can specify who we want to call.

Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London.\nThe question is very ambiguous there are many factors and variables that alter the best way to travel from X to Y.\nOne factor could be the price , another may be the time ; Perhaps another factor involved would be the date on which travel from one destination to another .

We were given details about the location but not the means of transportation or criteria of "comfort" for the passenger. However, the number of ways to reach from location A to location B is limited according to me, due to the fact that we cannot react from A to B by walking. So there are only a finite number of solutions to this problem.\nSo this means it is a well defined condition.\n
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Nicely put!
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think it is not a well-defined problem because it poses more problem than a feasible and final solution> London is not the solution. The solution is "the best way" and it does not clarify the meaning of "best way".
55a18a1db30d8409950015c2
Ralph,\n\nIn other words, "YES" the import IS REQUIRED in the program code.  I am not totally sure, but what is there allows the IO. to be used.  I think in "native" Java, the statement would be much longer.\n\nI found this when I decided not to use BlueJ.  I decided to use the NetBeans IDE.  But, in recreating the code in the IDE, the IO. statements were all error'd. So I copied the jar file to:\n    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk\jre\lib\ext and C:\Program Files\Java\jre\lib\ext\nI was then able to use it in Netbeans, just like standard imports.\n

I would hope that the compiler picks up on the fact that you are trying to assign either a double to an int in q3, and conversely an int to a double in q4 in their respective constructors, their being no (int i, int i) or (double d, double d) constructors defined.

This is because you have to set a variable with your operating system. This variable is normally called "Path".\n\nThat Path variable is a list of folders. When a folder is added to the path variable its content can be accessed on the command line without having to navigate to the folder.\n\nIf I add the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application" folder to my path variable I can then enter "chrome.exe" or "chrome" on a command prompt or terminal and it will open the chrome.exe file it found in the folder I added to my Path.\n\nTo use javac you could access it like this "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_31\bin\javac" but if you add the bin folder to your path you'll be able to simple type "javac".\n\nDepending where you installed it javac might be in a different folder than mine.

I don't think it's a very well defined problem. There are many factors that the question writer needs to think about and specify in the question. Like what do they mean by "best way"? And which London exactly, as there are about 6 cities named London around the world. So the question needs to be more specific.

I suppose this can be found in even the most simplest of devices e.g. eye glasses. An optician for example need not be concerned as regards the inner workings of the eye like an Ophthalmologist rather the optician is concerned that the eye glasses fit and sit well.

good example..remember that when we type a web address we also ignore the underlying system that analyses the address and searches for it through a multitude of databases.

Agreed, "a" solution exists..but whose "best" will it be?
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
But whose idea of "best" are we seeking to achieve...a best of minimum distance was not stated in the question and must therefor not be assumed
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
No...the problem hasn't been defined at all..constraints and requirements are also needed for a clearly defined question
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Agreed...so far all we have is a proposal..we need it fleshed out before we commit time and effort to finding any solution.

You got the same surprise using the scanner class:\n- in US, decimal separator is the dot: 5.4\n- in Europe (France in my case), we use the comma: 5,4\nIn short, you have to use what's setup in your locale, if you don't (try to enter 5.4 in France in a Scanner prompt), you get an error.

Make sure that there is nothing else within your body code except the System.out.printIn("Hello, world!"); and also try to put the java file of this alone in a separate file without any other java file. sometimes other java file cause this error while there are located in the same place during the compilation.

The user input is most likely stored in the args variable. Remember\n\n> public static void main(String[] args){...\n\nwell main is a method that has a string array parameter. (normally named arg or args) The argument passed to this parameter comes from the command line. So for example:\n\n    class FPAdder{\n      public static void main(String[] args){\n    	float sum = 0;\n    	for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++){\n    		sum += Float.parseFloat(args[i]);\n    	}\n    	System.out.format("%.2f%n",sum);\n      }\n    }\n\nThis program uses the args parameter. args.length returns how many arguments there are (the number of elements in the array) and the array's elements are accessed by their index numbers. args[0] returns the first argument\n\nIt's used like this\n\n> >java FPAdder 2.5 9\n\nwill print 11.50\n\nbasically 2.5 is put in args[0] and 9 is put in args[1]\n\n

That's weird because a class can have fields and methods.
55a077bda9a36ee6f2001479
First you must create the variable\nexample:\n\n> int x;\n\nThen you can initialize it:\n\n> x = 5;\n\nYou can also do it on the same line like this:\n\n> int x = 5;\n\nThis is how primitive types can be initialized. Java also has reference type variables that hold a reference to an object.\n\n> String aString = new String();\n\nThis initializes a string object.

Pardon me if I'm spamming :) I just went through the discussions and found this.\n\n> When we write a Java program, **we must tell the Java Virtual Machine\n> (JVM) which section of the code should be executed when the program\n> starts.** The body of public static void main(String[] args) (a.k.a the\n> main method) is where the JVM will look into for code to execute when\n> we start the program. **Note that the signature of the main method, i.e.\n> public static void main(String[] args), is fixed except that args can\n> be changed to other valid Java identifiers.** JVM is not capable of\n> finding entry point to the program with other method signatures.\n> **String[] args contains the arguments being passed into the program\n> when we start the execution.** The data type of the arguments is String\n> and since there might be multiple of them, an Array is used to hold\n> them. As an example, if we write a simple program, Max, to print out\n> the max number from a list of input numbers, we can execute the\n> program in the following way in command line: java Max 13 12 90 35 8\n> where the String Array will contains the elements {13, 12, 90, 35, 8}.\n> You will see more about methods in Module 03, String in Module 04 and\n> Arrays in Module 05. :) P.S. In BlueJ, we can select any method to run\n> directly without going through the main method. However, this feature\n> is exclusive to BlueJ and the purpose of it is to aid learning only.\n> In standard Java, all programs must start with the main method.\n\nPosted by one of our teachers :)

**main() specifies the start of the program.** Although, in Java you can write programs without main(), a complete execution will not be done without main function. Programs can be executed without main() by defining it in static initializer block. However all these concepts are way beyond the scope of this particular class.\n\nYou can create instances of a class without main and work with them. But you cannot execute the program as a whole. Hope you understand what I mean.\n\nIn the above example by Ricardo, you see the use of args in **public static void main(String args[])**. There are certain situations wherein you have to pass input while starting the execution of the program.\n\n**P.S.** String[] args and String args[] has almost the same function. String[] args is used when you have to define large number of arrays with the same data type (here the String). This alternative declaration form offers convenience when declaring several arrays at the\nsame time. \n\n**For example,**\n\n    int[] nums, nums2, nums3; // create three arrays\n\ncreates three array variables of type int. \n\nIt is the same as writing\n\n    int nums[], nums2[], nums3[]; // create three arrays\n\nThe alternative declaration form is also useful when specifying an array as a return type for\na method.\n\n

Hi, You just need to count green and red apples. Let's take 2D Square Apple problem. Schema as shown in video gives 5 red apples (two diagonals) and 4 green apples (up, down, left, right). The worm is moving by the rule: from red to green apple or from green to red apple. In 2D we start counting from middle which means from red apple and we have this order Red-Green-R-G-R-G-R-G-R and we finish counting. We see that this array has 5 red apples and 4 green apples which means that we can move to all (5+4=) 9 fields without breaking the main rule : the worm can only move into a cell where there is still an uneaten apple inside. \nFor 3D problem we have following. At cube you have 13 green apples and 14 red apples. Hint: In the first question of 3D you start from middle of cube which means from green apple and you make 27 element array. Start counting red and green apples of the 27-e array and you will get 14 green and 13 red apples which is contradiction to definition of cube with 13 green and 14 red apples. Hint: In the second question of 3D you start from the angles of cube which means from red apple. Analogue as 2D you create 27 element arrow but after counting you will get 14 red apples and 13 green equal as cube definition which means we can move to all 27 elements from cube without repeating some element.

But in this example in the video, how would the user specify that he wants all possible solutions starting from the upper left corner?  He is not allowed to put 0 in for row, nor 0 for column - or an error is given.\nThe video transcript says that 1,1 is the middle square.\nWhat does the user enter to get all possible solutions starting from the upper left corner?

Great, thank you so much for you kind of attention, I really appreciate it. Step by step, I begin to be familiar with the website. but I'm still facing some trouble, this one for instance, when I'd like to download a BlueJ project or application for working on my end, I keep having this error. Is the problem on my end or is general? thanks\n![Error][1]\n\n\n![saisir une description de l’image ici][2]/\n\n\n  [1]: http:/\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1436536253718041.png

(NO SOURCE) in the class's squared icon means that the project only contains a .class file and .java file is not provided, so you cannot see the code but you can run their constructors or methods ;)...  \n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14365348448652048.png

You cannot access the source code because you don't have the .java file. That's the reason for the error. Still you will be able to perform execution and get outputs.

Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Eva, I am 29 years old and I live in Pamplona, Spain. I am Chemical Engineer. When I was studying I learned Pascal and I really liked it. I have always loved programming so I have enrolled some courses here in edX like Sratch, Python, TypeSript... but honestly, I am very happy with this Java course, it starts from the very beginning so it is easy to learn and improve your programming skills, I have found others very difficult from one lesson to the next. I am excited about finishing it and go with the second part.\n\nThank you for this wonderful course!

The thermostat on the house I guess could be an abstraction.  When you set the temperature to a new setting or determine the airflow it controls a heater and AC unit in the basement.

I believe this is not a well defined problem.  If you google London you will find that we have a London England, London Ontario Canada, London Kentucky USA.  Although I do not know if there are more Hong Kongs out there, without something more precise like a GPS location it is not definite.  Also the mode of travel is not specified and there is no clarification to the word best.

What about the fuzziness of the word 'travel'?  Why should it mean just physical travel?  You could send email or make a phone call.  You could trace the route on Google Maps.  Or you could just sit back and imagine yourself flying across the earth.  Does it mean only possible ways?  Could you teleport?  Could you beam up to the Enterprise from Hong Kong then beam down to London?

Download the Java JDK from the above link and install it. Do remember the installation directory. When BlueJ asks for JDK on startup, browse the installation directory. **There will be a file named java(or a similar one) inside the bin folder.**
559eae59b30d84ae2100139c
You have to install JDK to run BlueJ. If you have downloaded the bundled version then JDK has been automatically installed along with BlueJ. Else, you need to separately download Java from [here][1]. **Remember the location where you are installing Java**. Start blueJ and when it asks for JDK location, browse the installation directory. **JDK will be inside bin folder.**\n\n [1]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

I don't think that the problem is well defined as it leaves the reader of the problem with many questions in coming up with a solution, and at the end of it all you can have various solutions that may or may not meet the questioning party preference.  For example, What method of transport is expected, and to what degree. At this point there are just too many questions unanswered to come up with a clear solution.

This is one of those issues with the English language and localization.\n\nZero vs Zed\nColor vs Colour\n\nI believe HKUST uses the US English way.\n\nIt would be quite amusing to see a programming language that allowed for this kind of localization though.  Like and option you tick and all the code changes over from one to another. (color to colour) That would be something...

I'm guessing you're talking about the worm/apples problems? There's a useful hint given to help you determine with ease if the answer is yes or no. You can also try "visualizing" the worm going through it's motions between the red and green apples... and see if can eaten them all, while respecting the no-diagonals-never-pass-same-square-twice.

559d8a39b30d84000200131b
Okay I just went back and listened to the video again.  I do understand your explanation, but how would we ever instruct this program to find all the solutions for the scenario where the worm starts in the upper left-hand corner?  If 1,1 is the middle square, as the transcript says, then 0,0 would be the upper left square; however, the program specifically tells the user that he must enter a row number between 1 and 3 (same for column).\n\nAnother way to see what I mean is by looking at the specific example in the video.  When the video shows that 1,1 were entered as the row, column, the output shows that the first square was (0,0).  That means that 1,1 was not the middle square as the transcript says - it was the upper left square. Look at all of the outputs to see this.\n
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think the key issue is that when programming we have to indicate precisely what we want to do and don't assume anything.

I believe it is a well defined problem as there is a solution that exists for the problem although it might have a lot of variables and different answers to the problem for example: what is defined as "The best way" to me it might be comfort, whereby to another person it might be cost.\nIt all depends on the person who travels and what their requirement would be to be classified as best way of travel.\n

Cell Phones can make a good example of abstraction. When we call a friend, we are just concerned about talking to him by not getting in the complexities like how my call will be transformed into electrical signal and then radio waves, how it will be directed just to him when there are billions of other cell phones between mine and his and how will his voice reach me back. Neither me nor him will care if the operator directing the call changes or the type of telephone signal changes unless we are able to talk to each other.

**"Is the problem statement "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" a well-defined problem?\nShare your thoughts!"**\n\nI think it is not a well defined problem. Because the question asks you "THE BEST TO TRAVEL". The best way can be anything. You might like to travel by road which you think it is the best way, I might travel by Air which I may think is the best way. So it is not constant. A well defined problem should be like " Finding the best, cheapest and fastest possible way to travel from Hong kong to London by Airways."\n\nThis is my opinion of what a well defined problem is? If I am wrong please do correct me by commenting below.\nThank you.
559de700a9a36e362d001376
When we write a Java program, we must tell the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) which section of the code should be executed when the program starts. The body of **public static void main(String[] args)** (a.k.a the **main method**) is where the JVM will look into for code to execute when we start the program. Note that the signature of the main method, i.e. **public static void main(String[] args)**, is fixed except that **args** can be changed to other valid Java identifiers. JVM is not capable of finding entry point to the program with other method signatures.\n\n**String[] args** contains the arguments being passed into the program when we start the execution. The data type of the arguments is **String** and since there might be multiple of them, an **Array** is used to hold them. As an example, if we write a simple program, **Max**, to print out the max number from a list of input numbers, we can execute the program in the following way in command line:\n\n> `java Max 13 12 90 35 8`\n\nwhere the String Array will contains the elements {13, 12, 90, 35, 8}. \n\nYou will see more about methods in Module 03, String in Module 04 and Arrays in Module 05. :)\n\nP.S. In BlueJ, we can select any method to run directly without going through the main method. However, this feature is exclusive to BlueJ and the purpose of it is to aid learning only. In standard Java, all programs must start with the main method.\n\n

% operation returns the remainder after division.\n\n10 % 2 will return 0 as the remainder as 10 is completely divisible by 2.\n\n4 % 7 will return 4 as remainder as 4 can not be divided by 7.\n\n\nPlease revisit the precedance table for more details about which operation goes first. \n\n**Hint** : () -> %/* -> +-

It is not a well-defined problem since there is no proper definition. What is the definition of the best way? There is no time period. Furthermore, Finding the best way for whom?

Dear all,\n\nI am just wondering whether a programming language could be a good example.\nIn a programming language, one can manipulate primitive data using functions or classes or structures. We do not need to know how the primitives have been made available to us in order to manipulate them as part of data abstraction mechanisms.\n\nIs it a possible example?\n\nThank you. Regards.

This is not a well defined problem as other have said the best way could mean fastest or cheapest and so on.  The other very important issue to resolve is which London.  Many former British colonies have the same place names as the UK, so our traveler could not only be unhappy with the mode of transportation and the route, but also end up on the wrong continent.

error1:\nline number :6\ndescription:I0-Output\nfix: IO.Output
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I do not believe that this is a "well defined" problem. There are many variables that are not defined within the question/problem. There are many things that need to be considered including cost, duration of the trip, comfort of the trip, and type of transportation. We do not know if the transportation is by bus, plane, personal car, or otherwise. The last thing that I would point out is that we do not know which "London" we are supposed to travel to. We could assume the the question is wanting to travel to London in the Uk. However, if the destination is instead London, Ohio than we would be off by an entire continent.

This is not well defined. It depends on your preference preference. Let's say you get sea sick easily. The best way wouldn't be by boat then. Or maybe you want to get there the fastest way possible. There is no one correct answer.

Converted bar code numbers are then added. You are doing the reverse in the 4th line. outputBarcode() will convert the bar code number into an equivalent bar code image. This line, if executed will ask you to provide a file name to save the newly formed bar code(data from addResult and image through outputBarcode()). \n\nHappy learning Java :)

In my opinion, it was not well-defined problem because which London is from canada or from UK. Another thing, we don't know if the best way is the cheapest way or the shortest way between another things.\nI believe that the problem needs more details to know whats things we need to identify the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London.

I don't think it's well-defined problem. Yes, it looks like one (has starting and ending points). However, when we start to think about it - one particular part - "the best" turn everything opposite and make it not well-defined problem. We can't answer  - better for whom? Better for what purpose? For professional shopper who is trying to visit as many shopping molls in different countries on the way? Better for businessman who is trying to get from point A to point B as fast and straight-forward as available? This problem requires more data and details, there for it's not well-defined.

There are many real life examples of abstraction-For example apps on an android device which perform \nfunctions like retouching your selfies or telling the co-ordinates of current location,We dont really care how these apps work...we focus on just whether our job is done or not.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Had this been a short distance, one could assume several restrictions such as time period, economical factors, comfort factors etc. In that case it would have been a well-defined problem but in this case, one cannot simply assume constraints and therefore needs to learn more about constraints making this not a well-defined problem. Yet again, if you take all the conditions for executing to be normal i.e. no natural/unnatural calamity has occured, then going via plane is most comfortable, economical and least time consuming mode of transport. Therefore someone may consider it a well-defined problem.

The statement "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" in my view is not a well defined problem, even though there are 'n' number of solutions (where 'n' being a huge number but finite).\n**Justification:** As mentioned above by my other colleges, there are many different factors that define and fit the criteria for the word "Best" like fastest, comfortable, etc...; apart from those the problem can also be viewed in many aspects like, best for what, whom, how, ...? Sight seeing, Business trip, etc..; and there are multiple levels of further requirements that can be applied for each (Economical, comfortable etc...;). All the permutations and combinations of the above mentioned would still add up to a very huge (near infinity) but finite number of solutions. So, the above mentioned statement is not a well defined problem. A problem always needs a anchor point from which it can be approached while keeping the problem manageable. One more point to be considered... As this question was asked in a programming class, the above mentioned statement problem with no restricting criteria would require very very long time to list out all the factors and then put it into a program, making this a problem that is impossible. Even though if such program was created, the computational power that would be needed to run and compute the program itself would make the problem not a well defined problem.

As additional information is required \nabout what 'best' means it is not a well defined problem because it can be understood as many ways for example less time of travel or cheaper or comfortable way of travelling.

Please avoid posting the entire code in the discussion forum. In case you encounter questions regarding coding questions, you can post the error messages or feedback you received from the grader or BlueJ. You are also high recommended to test your code in BlueJ before submitting to the online grader, this will help to save more submission. :)\n

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think  that it's not a well-defined problem...\nBecause traveling from Hong Kong to London could be done by different ways and with different methods,,, and when you ask what is the ***(best way)***, it depends on which way do you prefer,,, so if you prefer the fastest way, a plane ticket would be your ***(best way)***,,, but if you prefer to enjoy relaxing in ocean, traveling by the ship would be your ***(best way)*** >>>

Any system that a person uses today is typically familiar to him/her in only an abstracted way.  Just need to know how to use it, not how it does the job.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
As most others have been saying, the question is inadequate.  Without clearly defining the meaning of 'best', there are inevitably several different answers to the question.  There is the most comfortable way, the cheapest way, the fastest way, to name a few - and each of these is probably a different form of transportation.  It is also true that the destination and departure points are inexact, but this is probably less of an issue.

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
As found in this discussion thread already, additional information - for example, pertinent specifications, constraints, and limitations - undoubtedly should be considered when formulating a "best" solution.  For example, what is meant by "best" in the first place - cheapest, fastest, most reliable?  Also, are we looking to transport people or goods?  If the former, are there any physical restrictions and/or limitations that need to be considered.  Many factors may come into play.

We would recommend installing the 32-bit (x86) version as most browsers are 32-bit applications and we will need a 32-bit JRE for the browsers to view some of the course applets properly. Please check if the downloaded "Windows x86 Offline" file is corrupted by check it file size. The file size should be around 35.6MB.\n\nBesides, you can only install a 32-bit version of JRE if you are using a 32-bit Windows. You can install either 32-bit (x86) or 64 bit (x64) JRE if you are using a 64-bit Windows.

You will get an **Honor Code Certificate** if you get 60% or above in the overall assessment weighting. This certificate is free of charge and will be issued for everyone who get 60% or above.\n\nOn the other hand, you can pay $50 USD to upgrade you certificate to a **Verified Certificate** that is official signed by the instructor. You will need to go through a procedure with edX to prove your identity for this upgrade. We do not have an exact deadline for the upgrade now, but we will post it after we have confirmed with edX.

The question is not well defined from a computational standpoint but with regards to human to human communication the question may be sufficient. To the locations, all that is required is getting to London from Hong Kong. That means the journey is successful once the geographic boundary of London is reached. An "exact" pinpoint location is not required. Second, both London and Hong Kong have the distinct honor of having name prominence. All other locations in the world would need to be qualified such as "London, ST, USA" to avoid confusion. \nWhere the question falls short is in the "Best" and "Way." Best is subjective and opinion based and way is vague. We do not know what would constitute "Best" to the person posing the question. Nor can we fully understand "way"; does that mean "direction" North,East etc. or "method of travel" Walk, house-back, Airplane.

It is not a well-defined problem in that the term "best way" is subjective.  Is the best way referring to the shortest route, or the least expensive route, or the most scenic route?  Without additional definition of "best way" the question is too vague to easily answer.

Hi Arjen. Nice to meet you. You can consider constructors as default methods of a class (I.e, you can not stop the method from being executed). Constructors are always called automatically when an instance (object) is created. Whats the use of constructors ? They provide a way for initializing the instance variables of a class. You need not explicitly call the default constructor of a class. But you have to explicitly call the parameterized constructor(if you have defined one in your program). You will learn more about constructors in the upcoming classes.\n\nAnd yes, they behave like normal methods.

Driving a car is also a good example as we are mostly concerned with the accelerating pedal to accelerate, clutch to shift gears etc. and not knowing on how it is implemented in the system and worrying about the facts of it.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
**strong text**\nI think it is a well-defined problem, because if you desired a plane, a ship to go you will have specified steps you must do to travel .... I see the solution is exist and its steps are clear
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
A keyboard is an example
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
An iPad is an abstraction in many ways. 1. The screen touch system 2. The keyboard functions. 3. The "pinching" of the screen to make things small 4. The apps 5..... We don't know how it works but we know how to use it. 
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I agree, this is not well defined.\nWe would need to know exact start and end locations, method of transportation, desired date/time for departure and arrival, etc.

Hello,\nMy name is Jennifer.  I live in the United States and have a degree in Electrical Engineering as well as an MBA, and worked as a software engineer for about 8 years before deciding to leave the workforce and become a stay-at-home mom to raise my children.  After 15 years not working, I am now looking to re-enter the workforce - but programming languages have changed!  I need to learn Java, Python, and others.

Some examples of abstraction are: keyboard, mouse, my smart phone's screen / digitizer, computer, mammal, fish.  I tried to think of some examples that weren't simply abstract interfaces.  I suspect that animal or creature would also work as more abstract concepts than mammal and fish.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Pretty much what I was going to say. There are many variables that have to accounted for with it to be a well defined problem.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Hi Manu.\nJust adding a comment: most of the computational problems comes from the real world. When we specify a problem, we use natural language (full of ambiguities). This does not mean that the problem has no solution. As stated, the solution may vary, when adding certain rules. But this does not mean the problem is intractable. For me, the definition of "well-defined problem" as proposed still concerns the solution ...
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
In accordance with the given definition, a well-defined problem means that there is a solution to the problem. Therefore, considering this definition, the proposed problem can be characterized as "well defined". which does not mean that there is only one solution.\nI believe that for most of the issues proposed in the forum, concern the definition of which models will be used, as well as language ambiguities in the problem specification: natural language contain ambiguities. For example, the complementary Video quote that Quebec refers to the city and also to the town and surroundings in Canada ...
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
"Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" is not a well defined problem.  In the absence of specific details and qualifications, "best" is subjective and cannot be verified / tested against concrete facts or results.  This is currently an ill-defined problem with a number of missing variables / constraints.

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I believe it is not a well defined problem, because it does not specify where in London are the plans for travel. In order to find the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London, there are some pieces of information missing, like the exact location, and like other mentioned before the reason for travel, as well as the individual preferences.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
The question is inadequate as the variables and context defining the word ‘best’ are missing.\nIn a routing problem, the ‘best' needs to be clearly defined - Best - means shortest time, shortest distance, Lowest cost, Mode of transportation etc. Even in case of a defined mode of transportation e.g. airplane - fare, direct or with stopovers, airlines preferences or private jet etc has to be considered.

I'm thinking a user interface of any program on a computer would be a good example of abstraction. Based on the user's inputs, there are a lot of algorithms "behind the scenes" that manipulate the data given by the users and the results are presented on the user interface in a way that the user can understand.

559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I think it's not a well-defined problem at all, due to the fact that the point of reference is not crearly defined. London can refer to many different places. Besides, "the best way" may mean a lot of things: the shorter path, the safer one, the most accurate transportation, etc.\n
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
No, as it needs to specify WHICH London, what mode of transportation ("best", we assume air travel, but what if the traveler has a fear of flying.)
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Hello everybody!\nIn the problem statement, information about the parameter to optimise and the allowed means are missing. What does "best way" means? The statement should also precise about the locations (street, building...).
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
In addition to what it's been said on this topic, I would like to emphasize the ambiguous nature of that question. As other students have stated, to consider this a well defined problem  we would need to provide more details to that question, a better well defined problem may be: "Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London by plane between July 7th and August 1st from 2015"

How we perceive things/objects can be considered an example of data abstraction.
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
A word is an example of abstraction because it represents something totally different then a combination of letters. Take the word "chair" for example. A chair is a physical object that people sit on, but yet we can represent that object with just 5 letters.
559a2bd3b30d84995600104e
One of the classical examples of abstraction is the car. When we drive we are not aware about all the working system, because is not necessary. We just used the control interface, what means, the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator ...\n

I think it is a well-defined problem at least according to the definition.\nWe know that the solution will vary from person to person but we know that it does exist and that it can be found in a finite number of steps.\nTo explain it, let me take help of another much simpler problem which goes "To greet a person with his name preceded by the word "Hello"." Now, the solution to this problem will vary from person to person but we know it exists and that it can be found it in a finite number of steps. 1) Take note of the person's name whom you're greeting. 2) Say "Hello (his/her name)".\nThus it is a well-defined problem and so is the former.

Hi there, I'm Arjen. \n\nI'm currently a university AI student with some prior knowledge of C.\nI have seen the videos about constructors, but I still do not understand the purpose of it. The videos showed examples of arithmetic and initializing variables, but why would you do that in a constructor and not just in a function/method (or main itself)?\nAlso, if you call the constructor, does it just behave like a normal method? Something was mentioned about a specific object, but that remained rather vague for me.\nIn short, could you explain me what a constructor is and why I should use it (does it have different function in multi-class programs than in a single-class)?\n\nEdit: Should I see it as a possibility to create the Java version of a struct if we were dealing with e.g. User Information? Because a constructor would create a user with initialized information and a struct would, too.

Yes, it is a well defined problem. Because there are finite number of trvel routes are there by which a person can travel from hong kong to london.

This is a very common bug. System is a class in JAVA. As we all know, **the convention for writing a class name is to begin it with a capital letter** (camel-case). Always follow the conventions :)\n\n**P.S.** It is always a good habit to have indents in your code.\nYou can rewrite your code like this,\n\n    public class Lab01 \n    { \n      public static void main(String[] args) \n        {\n           // \n           // ---------------------------------\n           Code for outputting line 1 ...\n           Code for outputting line 2 ...\n           Code for outputting line 3 ...\n           // ---------------------------------\n        }\n    }\nwhich makes it look neat and elegant :) Happy learning Java !\n

I believe that this is not a *well*-defined question since there are many parameters to consider. \n\nFirst, The starting and arrival points needs to be defined. There are as many Hong KongS as LondonS. for example there is a hong kong **AND** a london in **Canada**.\nSecondly [You] have to define what is your priority in order to find the best way to travel, meaning that do you want to get there faster or do you want to get there with the cheapest mean of transportation ?\n\nSo again, I think this **not** a well-defined question.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
it's well defined problem if we consider the best way is the cheapest,most comfortable and fastest\nas:\n1- there is a solution (travelling from Hong Kong to London is achievable)\n2- solution can be done with finite number of steps (travelling from Hong Kong to whatever and so on until we reach our destination "London " )
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
As the question has many possible answers. so i think the problem is not well defined and more information needed to be given to reach a particular set of solution or answer.

Typing www.youtube.com on my browser makes the website load. I dont have to worry about how the packets are getting delivered, from which server, through which path. It just works and I dont have to know how. Using the car analogy we are interested in becoming drivers not mechanics.

Category - JRE\n\nIn the Course Info it's says that this course will use Java 7 but in the Tutorial on Software Setup it's JRE 8u40 and the link for downloading loads JRE 8u45. \nWhat to install now ?

With regards to a question such as this, I believe even your starting point needs more clarification. For example, the final destination is London, UK. Yet there are many specific points of destination in London. Even a hotel in London, UK will have many points of destination, the concierge, the reception, the restaurant, and many points within those spaces. To deny ambiguity any form of manifestation, longitude and latitude coordinates would have to be used before even defining the parameters of travel.

The project files were tested with BlueJ 3.1.4 in the previous offering. We feel more confident if we stick to BlueJ 3.1.4. \n\nOf course, you may try BlueJ 3.1.5. Please feel free to share your experience of trying the new version. If the technical problem cannot be solved, please revert to BlueJ 3.1.4.

We do not have an exact date for issuing the certificates now. However, we do understand that learners who complete the course early will need to wait a long time if the certificates were issued after the assessment due date. Therefore, we are currently arranging with edX staff to issue the certificates in batch. We will announce the exact dates once we have confirmed with edX.

Since it is summer I will use the example of an air conditioner. The control panel and the remote show what the available functions or settings are on the air conditioner. Pressing a button on the thermostat will cause the air conditioner to change the output temperature, but we are unaware as what goes on inside the air conditioner to obtain the desired temperature.

A refrigerator is a prime example. Functionally it has never changed and yet the technology is constantly changing and therefore innovating.

May I know which lecture note that you are talking about?
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
This isn't a well defined problem. More or less it appears as if it is asking a question. As previous have mentioned it is defining no constraints and therefore leaves it quite vague.

In research abstraction is a large component in devising instruments to test one's hypothesis. For example in order to test the charge of an electron, Milliken may had to abstract general functions the devise had to have in order to test an electrons charge.

Navigation System in car's is good example too I guess. We are focused on the instructions, map .. (output) and nobody know's what is going on underneath the device. We have many more examples nowadays such as digital watches, Vignette buying systems (aparats on  petrol stations), Digital Camera, etc ...

For me this is not well-defined problem, if we considere you shared only start and finish point, but with this two we can come up with multiple different results.\n\nSo I guess, it's defined problem, but not well-defined !\n\nGreetings to all and good luck :)

A Smart phone. The only thing that concerns us is the output on the screen after touching an icon. Nobody really thinks about how we are actually getting the output. Another example would be our PC or laptop. 
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Yes I agree that is a not well define problem even though we know what is the desired end result.However we don't have the answers to some questions that will allows to solve this problem in a well structured way. 
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
Another constraint not yet discussed it the mode of transportation.  I think the first step is to identify the various limitations and parameters.
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
I guess it is a well-defined problem because you have the starting point or current situation (Hong Kong) and the final point or future situation (London). The problem is the easiest way to get from A to B... \n\n\nRgds, \n\nMo.

You may use Java version 7 or later for this course. :)

Hi my friend - which version you've got installed now?\n\nI believe this course uses version 7.\n\nRegards, \n\nMo.

Category:  JRE\n\nI am dowloading Java but get the message:\n\n " A newer build of this version of Java already exists on your system.  It is not possible to install an older build.  Click OK to exit this installation".\n\nMy question is - is this okay for this course that my system is running a newer build of Java?\n\nI am using Windows 7 Home Premium, Service Pack 1.\n\nThank you.\n\n

A remote control and television. We are concerned with the abstraction of functionality by utilizing the remote. We care about the result occurring when we press the buttons on the remote, but now what is happening underneath the plastic panel. Interesting enough, if the remote ceases to work, we do not question the "how" inside the remote, but the batteries powering it.

Within the constraint of "best way," we also face deeper and more perplexing constraints, no? For example, if we limit the problem to the fastest way to travel to London from Hong Kong, would we be looking at statistics? If so, is there a time period? If we say the fastest way to travel to London from Hong Kong is by plane, but the following week there were a typhoon cancelling all flights to London for x amount of time, would we still consider this the fastest mode of transportation? Perhaps this question may seem bizarre due to the distance between the two cities. However, if we were to change the question to the quickest way to travel to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Given the same climatic circumstances, would it not be faster to take a bullet train to Shanghai? Thus, this does not adhere to the "finite" solution quality of a well-defined problem.

Well put
559a2b19a9a36e86bc001099
The problem needs to define constraint of what is "best way" for example, fastest, cheapest, or most comfortable, because different people will understand the problem differently.\n\nI would prefer the cheapest and most comfortable for direct flight.

I am extremely motivated to take this course, but I want to know when the certificates will be distributed once we completed the course with passing grade of more than 60%. Is it after 31 DEC 2015 or at regular intervals.\n\nThank You for giving me this opportunity to learn Java form basics.
