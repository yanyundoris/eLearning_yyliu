I want to ask how to use NDK and OpenCV with C++11 supported in Android Studio. It is quite complex for me to configure gradle. And I have tried many ways and demos from the web. But they only work for particular gradle version. Is there a general introduction in this topic?

Hello.  I have answered all the questions with a high score but cannot complete the exercises.  I am not sure if the version of Android you are using is out-of-date or the instruction is incomplete.  However, the exercises do not work for me.  I have copy/pasted.  \n\nI have to bow out of the course.  Thank you for your help.  God bless.

Hello,\nAfter this exercise, when we added background thread for drawing canvas, game in my emulator started to work very slowly. It reacts quickly to buttons, but animation itself is much slower than on main thread before.\nAny suggestions on how I can speed that ? Maybe some configuration option ?

Hello,\nI have been on this course for about two months and done the step-by-step instructions.  I cannot get past week one Greet Friend.  It seems no matter what I do, I get error codes.  I code in Java and have made Java applets and desktop programs but this is tough.\n\nI will not post my answer, per honor code, but I do not know where to place it.  OnClick will not go through all the if-else statements.  Also, if I move the declarations (button, textMessage) onClick cannot read them.  If someone can help me through this, I'm sure I could power through the rest of the course.

For me it was quite an interesting course, short and to the point. Sufficient theory and exercises gave a good start for Android. Kudos to the course staff! \nBare with me, I know we've barely scratched the surface in this course which is why I've also taken in parallel the Beginner Android course on Udacity. While that one helps you learn OOP - for those who already know it can become rather tedious, however you learn a lot about Layouts, design, methods on how to approach an app in a very friendly and easy way to understand. Despite being a beginner's course it goes more in depth on that part compared to this one, however there are plenty of more advance courses over there. Plus, there are Android Dev interviews, tips and tricks, Material Design aspects included. :)\n\nSo what should we do next? I compiled a list of some MOOC's that I will be following but I was looking for some recommendations (courses, books, blogs, references, tutorials etc.) Sadly, EdX is seriously lacking courses in Android... in spite of having some extraordinary CS courses out there.\n\nEveryone, feel free to comment! :)

Dear Sir,\nI am facing a problem running your automated tests.  The testChangeText fails throwing the following security exception:\nCaused by: java.lang.SecurityException: Injecting to another application requires INJECT_EVENTS permission.\nI have been debugging the tests and everything seems to be fine until the test performs the click on the greetButton. The name 'John' is sent to the app correctly, but the click on the button stops the execution.\nI have revised the installation steps, the project load steps and the test preparation steps, and everythig seems to be ok.\nI am using Android Studio 2.1.1 under linux. My emulator is Nexus 5 API 23\nCould you please give me a clue about what is happening?\nThanks in advance\nJosep

Apparently, my app has a problem with connecting to the server. I followed all the steps to set up the nodeJS server and it works in the browser. Looking into the cmd, I don't get any requests from the app. \n\nI first edited the Constants with the IP of my server. Then what I've done was to use the Picasso to load the URL and getting the position of the friendInfoList, then resized it and center cropped it fro each picture. It seems that this approach doesn't get me there.\n\nDo we have to load all the pictures using a single call using the Picasso?

This page tells us to choose a Blank activity. In my Android studio 2.0, that alternative does not exist. The closest are Empty and Basic.\n\nComparing my source code with source code in a later video, I conclude that we should use the **Basic** activity for the Hello World app.\n\n(The Empty activity also works fine, but throws me off track by having less source code than what I see in later videos.)

I got the app to work as intended. However, when I ran the test, I got NullPointerException. However, the test passed after I replaced part of the matchesSafely method of ContactsTest.java from\n\n\n    Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(drawable.getIntrinsicWidth(), drawable.getIntrinsicHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n\nto\n\n    Bitmap bitmap = null;\n    if (drawable!=null){\n        bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(drawable.getIntrinsicWidth(), drawable.getIntrinsicHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n    }\n\nAm I allowed to do that, or is there really something wrong with my code that I need to fix? \n\nThanks in advance.

Hello, I was wondering about the red bulb in android studio within the instruction video of the exercise: greet friend (part2).\n\nIn my android studio the bulb doesn't have the button "Make MainActivity implement …." \nOnly option is "insert App indexing API Code"\n\n\nWhere does it come from and how can I solve this problem? (The same thing is during the insert of the switch where I should be able to insert an alternative way of specifiyng the string..)\n\n2)\nSo I entered the @override manually and filled it with the switch but the function is not given. In my emulator I can type in the name but no respond if I hit the button. Is it something with the manual entry? Or is there just a fault in the code?\n\nGreetings\n\n\n

Error:Conflict with dependency 'com.android.support:support-annotations'. Resolved versions for app (22.2.0) and test app (22.0.0) differ. See http://g.co/androidstudio/app-test-app-conflict for details.\n\nI found a stackoverflow post about this, and I've found where it lists the 22.0.0 in build.gradule(module:app)\n\nHowever, if I change that to 22.2.0 to match the app apk, it says that module isn't available for download. I cannot find the APK for the app where it says 22.2.0 to change it to 22.0.0 and so my test fails.\n\nAlso, I'm using hour instead of hour_of_day and the program is functioning properly it is NOT returning a 12 hour time and I've verified that by outputting the string hour to the text window instead of the "Good Morning" or whatever. \n\nPlease advise about either, although I'd assume my coding doesn't matter if the app works, I'm wondering WHY you say it won't, but it does.

In the "[Android Activity Intents][1]" video , on the slide titled Intent to Start Activity (~2:20 - ~2:30) the graphic indicates that there are two Intents - one created by the source and one used to create the target activity.  Does this mean that the Android Framework makes a copy of the Intent?  Or is it really just one Intent object shared by the two activities?  \n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+1T2016/courseware/9fd029452bf2495f819dd083fe769a5d/b783cf3f209c473b9802f16475d1bf10/

As, emulator run slow on most of computers.\nIf, you have problems with emulator you can use your physical device also for testing or use genymotion as emulator.\n\nYou just have to follow the steps for physical device:\n(Steps are as per official android release, may vary for other android but options remain same)\n\n-Goto Settings.\n-Down below at end, Select "About Phone".\n-Than, tap on "Build Number" 5 times.\n-Pop up will appear saying "You are a developer".\n-Go back, you will see that above "About Phone", "Developer Options" tab just appeared.\n-Open that and select "Usb debugging" as enable.\n\nNow, Connect your device.\nWhen you will now click on "Play" button, your device will appear.

As a way of getting things clear in my head, I created an activity called MainActivity with three buttons with id aButton, bButton and cButton. I also created three separate activities named SwimActivity, RunActivity and JumpActivity. How can I implement this in code such that when aButton is clicked, it opens SwimActivity, when bButton is clicked, it opens RunActivity and when cButton is clicked, it opens JumpActivity. Note that the SwimActivity, RunActivity and JumpActivity also contain buttons which when clicked should open an activity with list items. \nI just can't get my head around. Need help please.

When I run the test on my program, it succeeds on 2 tests, but then fails on the 3rd test and gives me the following:\n\nandroid.support.test.espresso.NoActivityResumedException: No activities in stage RESUMED. Did you forget to launch the activity. (test.getActivity() or similar)?\n\nWhat does this mean? When I run the app itself on my Android device, it works perfectly. Restarting Android Studio didn't help. I also get this error on Assignment 2.\n\nBy the way, I doubt this matters, but I had to change the minSdkVersion to 19 to run the test on my Android device. I can't run the test on the emulator because I get\n\nERROR: x86_64 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration! Please ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable. CPU acceleration status: HAX kernel module is not installed!\n\nActually, I just realized that my computer doesn't support VT-x. That might be why Intel HAXM is not working even though Android SDK says that it's installed.

I was tackling the assignment for week two, the chat app, and I tested it on my phone and it seemed to do just fine but i was getting an error when running the tests for the assignment\n\nandroid.support.test.espresso.base.DefaultFailureHandler$AssertionFailedWithCauseError: 'with text: is "This is a test"' doesn't match the selected view.\nExpected: with text: is "This is a test"\n\nBut taking a look in the ChatClientTest class I saw that it inputs "This is a test" and clicks the button as the user but checks that the R.id.mymessageTextView view has "This is a test" as well, but this view is the one corrresponding to the responses from "John" so the message that it is going to receive is "Hey, How's it going?". \nSo I wanted clarification on how to take this screenshot, am I allowed to modify the ChatClientTest?, since checking for "Hey, How's it going?" in the R.id.mymessageTextView seems to run the tests with a green bar.\nThanks in advance,\nRegards!

Good Morning, I tried to look for the following issue but I did not find nothing. Sorry for the inconvenience that I provide you with this. I am trying to do a long description short.\nWhen I try to run the HelloWorld, pops up the message "ADB is not responding" (RESTART/CANCEL do not have any effetct)\nChoosing CANCEL appears message "Error running app: unable to obtain debug bridge" [OK]\nThen I installed some old SDK platforms (nothing resolved).\nThen I tried to cd in /path/where/is/abd and tried the command "./adb" but system answered "/lib64/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.14 not found (required by ./adb)" \nAfter "yum search libc6" i figured out that fedora needs glibc-devel.i686 but when I try "yum install glibc-devel.i686" system answers that " Package (...) already installed and latest version, nothing to do".\nI found here http://www.rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=glibc a glibc_2.14 but it is for Mageia or OpenSuse.\nAt this point I do not know how to try to resolve and I could use an hand.\nSorry for this and sorry for may english, I am not mother tongue.\nThank you\nConone\n

During the first lesson, the professor guided us through the process of unlocking the developer access on our phones (instead of using the simulator), which I did, because I thought it would be neat to actually see it on my phone.  Anywaus, Thursday evening, my phone started beeping and it had a message like 'The end is near' on the screen and a count-down timer ...  my text messages were all garbled, and apparently I ordered an Uber car and had to pay a penalty for not meeting it ...\n\nAnyways, the point is that I think by accessing the Developer controls I opened my phone up to hackers ...  I had to totally wipe everything and reload the presets.  My phone is old and not on the most recent OS, so maybe that had something to do with it, but I urge folks to be cautious and I'm curious if anyone else had experienced something like this ...\n\nBest,\nJohn

On clicking the project tab, nothing appears for me. Surprisingly, when I opened this existing project, no build occurred for me. What should I do?

I wrote my code and tried to run the test. However, I get NullPointerException. I get that even if I blank the whole onClick function, so it must be coming from somewhere else. I have no idea where it's coming from. How should I fix this?\n\nThanks in advance.

 1. Evidently this course need to update its material, I found this [very good tutorial][1]\n 2. you don't need to install (almost) all SDKs to develop in this phase, work with SDK installed by default\n 3. don't try to work Android Studio (as guest) on a virtual machine because its emulators won't work but you work connected to physical device (phone, tablet). If you use a virtual machine, you need to assign lot of resources (mainly to graphics memory)\n 4. built-in emulator of Android Studio is very very slow, better use [Genymotion][2], how-to install [here][3].\n\n\n  [1]: https://x-team.com/2016/01/how-get-started-android-programming/\n  [2]: https://www.genymotion.com/\n  [3]: http://www.coderefer.com/how-to-install-genymotion/

It seems the tutorial video for this section is ***outdated***, for recent version of AS (1.5.x), "Blank Activity" template is different respect to video, should we maybe choose "Empty Activity" template? What differences exists between these two activities?\n

I will post this here in case it might be useful to someone else.  After writing my code, I tested it manually and it worked just fine but the test script kept failing.  Specifically, it kept throwing up an error regarding injection permissions.  A bit of a search online revealed that this can happen when the emulator moves too fast and attempts to move on before the soft keyboard has fully closed.\n\nThe solution is to throw in a delay after the line .perform(typeText("John"),closeSoftKeyboard()); in the MainActivityTest code.  I used:\n\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(1000);\n        }\n        catch (InterruptedException e) {     }\n\nand everything worked just fine thereafter.

I have a low-end PC, with a 1 GB RAM and a 2 GHz processor. And as expected, Android Studio was a painful experience on my PC. Firefox and Studio can't run simultaneously, not to mention a PC slower than ever. Are there any alternatives to Android Studio, that can work properly on my PC? Eclipse runs fine, but can I do this course and broadly, Android app development, on Eclipse?\n
