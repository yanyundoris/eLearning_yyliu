PowerCalculator: what is powerN(0,0) ?
n⁰ is generally 1 ? Except undefined for 0⁰. But as as negative powers shall return 1, I suppose it should return 1 for 0⁰, as well as for the other zero powers.

Instead of using if and then im trying to consider the options of ... <!-- this.type - anotherchoice --> so if the value of both can be 2, 1 or 0, I use switch to distribute the result of the difference. Im not sure if I can do arithmetic operations like that, but since ... <!-- this.type and anotherChoice.getType() --> are supposed to have int values, I should be able to do that... Am I wrong?

"Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London"
I don't think it is a well-defined problem due to the fact there are many different "elements" you would have to figure out. If I go on google maps and lookup the best way to London from Hong Kong. Then, I would have to specify my current location, mode of transportation, and etc. There could be a flight that was only "x" amount of hours, but just to get to the airport could be 4 hours travel time. ETC. The best way to have a well-defined problem would be stating how, when, price, and etc. Just trying to find the best time to travel to London would be one problem to figure out. If, money wasn't the problem, you could consider any "well-defined" solution wasn't a problem. Because most of us are under the constraint of money as well... This makes our "well-defined" solution a bit different. Also, we must consider: any special needs(physical), time that we would have to "travel," and etc.

Module 5 Array Exercise
Code segment 1 : For the code to run correctly , a should have initialized int[] a = new int[4];  Code segment 3: The code needs a pair of bracket instead of parenthesis. Also, in the if bracket a[] instead of a(). Code segment 4: The array type is int, but the content of the array has double instead of integer. If all the corrections are made the output is 2.5 as the average. Code Sample 1: The output is -30.0 because it is the smallest integer in the array. Code sample 2: The output value of counter is 6 because there are 5 integers in the array list that is divisible by 2 with a remainder of negative one or positive one and the counter is increase by one which equals 6. Code sample 3: I am confused about this one. Code sample 4: The output is 10 because i is increased and j is decreased and the product is added to some until j is negative which is not true and ten is return as the output. TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THESE CODE I RAN ALL OF THE CODES AND I USE THE DEBUGGER. I AM CHEATING BUT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LOOP IS DOING TO RETURN THE VALLUE FOR i and j to be set to sum.

Module 02 Graded Problem Task 3
In answering these questions I am not sure if I made an assumption or if I just did not understand what was being asked. I did not see in the instructions for the problems that we were supposed to use integer rules to solve them. In fact the directions talk about using only one decimal place in any answer. In the second equation we are asked to find the value of 2 + 15 / 6   4.0 is 10 and 10 + 2 is 12. The correct answer as given though is 10 because it drops the decimal from the 15 / 6 to give an answer of 2 instead of 2.5. Did I miss something in the instructions?

Examples of Everday Abstractions
There are quite a few of different abstractions that are used everyday in our life. An example would be texting on your phone. Regardless of the language, words or phrases used in a text message, the functionalities remains the same. You want to send a message to a particular person and receive a message from a particular person in a timely manner. That is the main focus behind a text message on your phone. This can also be true with an email. Another example could be a heater (during the fall/winter seasons) or an air conditioner (during the spring/summer seasons). The functionalities of the products is to keep you comfortable regardless of the changing temperatures. All of us are not knowledgeable on how these products work but know that as long as it keeps us warm or cool (depending on the season), it is successfully performing its duty.

Poor programming style
The Rock, Paper, Scissors lab should be modified to teach better programming style. Specifically, the type should be a string "rock", "paper", "scissors". This would yield readable code. e.g. pseudocode    The latter requires extra documentation and is more prone to error. If a student went to work and wrote the latter they should be sent back after a code review to rewrite the code. Let's teach the right way from the very start.

Where does rotation come into it?
When looking at the draw() method, I see it is passed an integer for rotation. Cool, sounds fun, I'm all for a bit of rotation. Where I'm getting confused is that I see no way to deal with the rotation when adding the image. canvas.add(image, x, y) doesn't include a parameter for rotation, nor does new ColorImage. I'm not even seeing a setRotation() method anywhere. Can someone please point to how to deal with this parameter?

But obviously it's a Java thing to force a certain way of writing code. Can anyone send me to a decent explanation of this structure requirement. OR if you think I'm doing something wildly wrong then do me a solid and help me out here. The reason I find it strange is because I have multiple return statements in my code. One for every possible if/else scenario (bad boiler plate solution to the problem). For example   So, since I have return statements in there, why is it telling me I'm missing a return statement?

I wrote some code which passed the test, but am still puzzled by the result.  But I am not sure, how this code would work, if the very last card was facing up, and the game was played again, and again. A lot of people, here, helped me with their posts, in completing this task, so I thought, I might shine a light, to guide those following!

If I download it into my Bluej folder, I do not find it when I try to work on the project. I finished HTML intermediate succesfully before. It is not like i am computer illiterate. But the mishmash of the course parts here is something I cannot assemble or make sense of. Please. Make the edx page the place to be. Link through directly. That is what works so well. This is what makes people like me just drop the course.

Please help with InputMismatchException
First of all, I have to say that I posted the three Labs and all of them are correct and I got all the points. The problem is that after some tests with several type of data in BlueJ something change and an error happens:  I have several doubts: - First of all, where is the problem? - And then, is there any way to reset everything in order to be able to start again with the tests? Now I cannot input anything even the same inputs that were working before because the Class stops as soon as it starts (I tried to compile, etc, but to no avail). I have the same problem now with the others (multiply and cuadratic), and maybe the problem appears when changing to input floats, but if I understood right Double is the right type to float numbers, no matter how big they are. I don't know. I will really appreciate any advise with this . Thanks in advance.

MY Observations
line 28: The variable currentFloor was declared  final  and so its value can't be  changed or altered ,therefore the value 1 cannot be added to it. Line 32: Similarly since the variable currentFloor is declared Final,its value cannot be  decremented  this goes against the rule of a variable been declared  final  as that variable in other words is called a  CONSTANT  variable ( i.e cannot be changed ) Line36: The syntax for declaring a do While statement does not allow a semicolon after the  do  closing brace instead it has to be after the the closing parenthesis of the  while  condition. Line 47:since the if statements only have  one statement each to execute , This may not be a bug  However it is advisable to use the  else if  statements to make the if statements clearer and easier to follow. Line 54: We should have (i=0;i<5;i++) and  NOT  (i=0,i<5,i++); because semicolons and not commas are found in between the statements in the parenthesis also, there can be no semicolons after the parenthesis except after the statement to be executed within the for loop curly brackets  { }

Suggested fix: Replace the comma with a semicolon.   Description of bug: Trying to reference an unknown variable Suggested fix: Matching the variable with the correct case as when it was declared.     Description of bug: Line ends without a semicolon. Suggested fix: Add a semicolon to the end of the line. Apparently I missed out on the class error that other people experienced. I copied to contents of the class into BlueJ and not the actual class itself, so the capitalization issue was avoided.

MOD 03 Graded Prob Task 3 - Diagram in wrong orientation?
This relates to the diagram in Task 3, where we need to adjust the moveForward method to allow for the orientation of the car. The diagram appears in Task 3A, but is actually being used to justify the 2 formulae we need for Task 3B, such as: Distance to Move in x Direction = Distance to Move * cos(Angle of Rotation) The top left of the image includes an x-y axis to remind us that the positive y direction is down in computer graphics, rather than up as in "normal" mathematics. This means that while in normal maths we measure angles anticlockwise from the positive x axis, in computer graphics we measure them clockwise from the positive x axis. So this diagram has the car at an angle of about -30 degrees. But the red arc that shows the angle being measured has the arrowhead at the bottom end. That makes it look like we're measuring from the sloping line of the triangle down to the base, about 30 degrees. We're not. We measuring from the base to the sloping line, and since that is in the negative rotation direction, we get -30 degrees. So the arrowhead should be at the top end or arc, since we measure from the x axis. But, if we're trying to make this diagram as clear as possible to those who aren't mathematicians, we shouldn't have chosen to demonstrate it for -30 degrees in the first place. We should chosen a simpler example that stays in the "1st quadrant". Let's use an angle of 30 degrees. So, I suggest we should flip the triangle vertically. Make the car travel from top left to bottom right of the screen at 30 degrees to the horizontal. The red arc should start at the horizontal edge of the triangle and arc down to the sloping edge of the triangle, with the arrowhead at the sloping edge.

I thought that in the first calculation ++a will add 1 to a (++a) and in the second calculation a++, a would stay the same, as 1 is added after the result is evaluated so "a" will be 7 in the calculation. - Why do both final values of a give "a" result of 9? In the first result I can understand that "a" will have a final value of 9, as a = 8, so ++a = 9 but what about the second evaluation?

Mistake in Car2 Demo?
I have been testing the Car2 Demo originally included in Module 03 and have put the if-else statement in the code: public void moveForward(int dist)      if (dist < 0) dist = - maxDist; else dist = maxDist;             This would suggest that the `double dist` has the incorrect value assigned to it and as a result `double distKm = dist / 100.0;` gives the wrong distance i.e.: 100 meters instead of 100 Km. Hey I would buy this car!!! Perhaps it is a hybrid and moved 99 Km on the battery??? I would just like to know what the declared value of dist really is.

It would have been more helpful to expand the description of opening this example program. To just say "Start BlueJ and open the downloaded project" is insufficient instructions to new learners. They should really have been directed to double click the file "package.bluej" which would open the completed solution in BlueJ automatically for them.

With little or not thought about how the ATM dispenses out the money with high level of accuracy, How it is able to check your balances and just a click away and giving you appropriate feed back. All these technicality are Hidden from the Users. (2) Another simple but basic example of Abstraction is a Simple KEY AND DOOR. We just turn the keys to lock once or twice and the same to Unlock without been conscious of how this works. Its simple but still i think its abstraction in very basic form

Documentation of Canvas add method misleading?
I've got two separate issues here. I ran into these issues when doing the Lab 4 Task 2, displaying the Rock/Paper/Scissors image. I'm using the first add method of the Canvas class, the one with only 1 parameter. That is: public void add(CanvasObject canvasObject) I discovered that switching the order of the setX, setY and add statements in my solution makes no difference. That is, I get the same results whether I : (a) Use the add method to put the CanvasObject on the Canvas, and then use the CanvasObject setX and setY methods to move it to the right spot; or (b) Use the setX and setY methods first to specify the location, and then use the add method to put it on the Canvas. The documentation for the first Canvas add method states: "Adds a canvas object to the canvas at position (0, 0)." If this were true, then (b) above should ignore the setX and setY commands and always place the image at (0,0). It doesn't. I suspect the documentation should something like say: "Adds a Canvas object to the canvas. If the object's x and/or y positions have not been set, they default to zero. That is, if neither has been set the image will be placed at (0,0)" Second issue: Where the documentation of the add method refers to "a canvas object", should this be "a CanvasObject object". That is, we're referring to an object of type CanvasObject. This issue occurs multiple times in both add methods.

Module 05 Graded Problem Task 1
I made the program and test it in BlueJ with all the requirements that are in the exercise, the output is fine, but when I send the code, it says:   Number of Test Case Groups Passed: 0/1 Sorry! Your program might ask for extra user input or it might not read any user input. Your program code runs longer than we expected. The execution of your program is cancelled. The test result cannot be generated." 1) Do I need to make a main to send the problem (I only complete the body of the method and test it, it goes well in BlueJ with the expected result)? 2) Do I need to use the IO.output to ask for the parameters? I don't understand what is the problem with the exercise i send.

STAFF The Canvas is too big!
I am working on the Rock-paper-scissors and it is fun. Unfortunately the images for the assignment are very large and so the canvas is necessarily very large too. When the canvas is instantiated either the top or bottom extend beyond the limits of my laptop's display. This prevents access to the minimize-maximize-close buttons or at the very least it is not possible to see the entire canvas to know if everything looks correct. I don't see why it would be necessary to use such large images for the purposes of this assignment? I want to use smaller images, but this would confuse the 'grader'

daily life examples of abstraction.
Over daily life is concenred with a lot of abstraction like a user using pc/laptop know how to use pc/laptop to meet his/her requirment but doesn't how his/her requirment fulfilled by pc/laptop. 2.Every person knows How to make a call but doesn't working of phone. We all know how to print our document but very few of us know working of printer and many more example are available in daily life where we can abstraction.

MODULE 04 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 4
I have been trying to understand wht the results are B and F , but not clear yet, If the value of score is 100. the result of 100/10 is 10 then we compare the first case and it matches, so we assihn grade = 'S' , we continue comparing becuase there is no break, when we compare cases 9 and 8 , they don't match so the value is not modified, then tere is a break , and the grade continues to be S . Similar withn 79, when it finds te match the other cases don't match , so why the value is replaced?

setScore Array method example question
I do not understand one part of the setScore method of the Array section of Module 5. Why did we initialize an integer type variable called 'size' that was initialized with a value of 'score.array.length' when in the actual method for loop we never referenced that 'size' variable. We continued to use the 'scoreArray.length' in our for-loop-condition. Was that step necessary? If so, why is it necessary if we did not use that variable throughout the method? Per the lecture, this was the proper method...      //length is a constant instance variable for each array that //gives the number of elements in the array int size = scoreArray.length:

The dashboard on a washing machine.
Think about the washing machines that we use in our every day lives. It can also be a good concept of abstraction. Think of the control panel of the washing machine, its dashboard. The switches and the buttons on it are what that makes the washing machine come to life. The buttons each represent a particular function of the washing machine that it does when we press them. Functions like the spin rates, the temperature, and everything else that a washing machine does. The thing is that we press the buttons for the washing machine to do the function it represents and the machine does. We don't know how the the process is done, how the machine works or we don't care how it is done. All we care about is the output that the machine gives. That is all we care about.

Lab 05, graded task 2
Update;; I was missing something silly... I wasn't attempting to reproduce that particular test case correctly. Currently working on figuring out how to solve that test case now.   Update 2;; Figured out what I did, I had my if else statements implemented incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect order of operations when returning true or false   ;; This thread can be deleted if desired, or left for others to learn from my mistake (so long as I am not violating the honor code, which I do not believe I am as I have not posted my code).   * flipped up is 3. The game required me to match 3 & 4 again to receive the "congratulations" message. So, as far as I could tell, my code was correct and should have passed that test.  I used a counter that counted how many cards were flipped up and compared them to what the value should be when all of them were flipped up, indicating a win. returning either true or false depending on the result. Any tips/thoughts would be much appreciated. Am I missing something potentially silly and obvious? Thanks have a great day,

There are different modes of travel between the two cities. Also I think London UK is implied but there are several cities around the world that are also named London. Also the best time to travel in between the cities may also mean the time of day and/or season of the year.

Askfor BarCode
Just passing by the discussion section ... After saw the video first ideia that come to my mind was to make a simple BarcodeGen, not the same as the video. The program asks you a number and then it simple converts it to a barcode. Though it would give me some work but it's pretty easy. Just sharing with you guys.(Portuguese but i think anybody understand after viewing the classses.

Lab 05 Bug
Hi all, I think there's a bug in the Lab 5 code. It can easily be cheated if a player enters the same card twice, that way he can finish the entire game :). Or is this how the game was intended to work? P.S, one if statement solved the issue for me :). This course is rather fun though. Will there be certificates awarded for this particular course.

Examples of data abstraction
One example of data abstraction is a pilot in an airplane. Say the airplane has a cockpit that has been designed so that one pilot can fly multiple kinds airplanes without having to be re-trained. An example is the MD-10 and MD-11 airplanes, or the entire Airbus series of planes. When the pilot pushes the throttle and makes movements with the flight yoke, he doesn't need to know what the computer that controls the physical mechanisms on the airplane is doing. He doesn't even need to know which kind of airplane he is in, as the computer has been programmed to give a similar feel and control to different airplanes. In this case, data abstraction applies to physical mechanisms, computer mechanisms, and even to airplane type.

data abstraction's example
we all are using internet on our laptop in our daily life for different purposes like office work, e-learning, e-banking, e-shopping and the last but not the least social networking. in all these aspects, we only care about what the operations internet perform without caring about how it will perform these tasks like whatever the internal operations the internet perform from collecting the data to establishing the network frame between different users. so this could also be an example of data abstraction in our daily life.

when testing it tells me    It is correct that only one Canvas object is created. It is correct that the two instances of ColorImage is found on the Canvas object. It is correct that the two instances of ColorImage are created by the default constructor. The dimension of Canvas object is incorrect. It should be just fit for showing two images side by side. and I think the problem the problem is here (A Canvas object is then created by calling the Canvas constructor with arguments. The first arugment is twice the width of the first(or second) ColorImage object while the second argument is the height of the first(or second) ColorImage object. You can obtain the width and height of a ColorImage by using the getWidth() and getHeight() methods in the ColorImage class.) but I do not know how to fix the problem or do these argument .

why should i get failed while the value of second part for paper and scissorrs change? i have put the right number for each element for paper and scissors  Test method draw of rock with x = 0, y = 0, rotation = 0 Passed because of the following reasons: the loaded image is rock the X position of image is correct. the Y position of image is correct. the rotation of image is correct. Test method draw of paper with x = 18, y = 22, rotation = 90 Failed because of the following reasons: the X position of image (11) is incorrect. the Y position of image (25) is incorrect. the rotation of image (360) is incorrect. Test method draw of scissors with x = -99, y = -17, rotation = 270 the X position of image (-20) is incorrect. the Y position of image (20) is incorrect. the rotation of image (180) is incorrect.

Loss of precision
I am puzzled by a loss of precision in the answer to the quadratic equation problem. When I attempt to calculate the answer in one long expression:  where all the variables are double, I get answers that are incorrect. They might be 0.899999 vs. 1 for example. but if I break the calculation up into intermediate steps and variables: // break down the math steps   I get a correct result. All variables have been declared as double. What am I doing wrong?

In the moveForward() method, it's calculating  gasUsed  based on  distkm  which is calculated based on the parameter  dist , but if the user entered  dist  value as a negative number (moving backward), the variable  gasUsed  will end up being a negative value and so the instance variable  gasInTank  will increase which is not logical. So I think that it should be:

Module 02 Debugging
Java is case sensetive language so Class with first letter writtern as uppercase letter is a mistake. We have to write word "class" instead of "Class"   curly bracket is used in different way in comperetive with curly bracket above. Instead of line 4 the curly bracket has to be on line 5   between IO and output a dash is used instead of point. we have to write IO.output();  in brakets is used wrong sybol. INstead of quotation mark ' symbol is used. We have to change ' with ".  After the final closing bracket on this line a comma is used. We have to change comma "," with semicolon ";"   Java is a case sensitive language. A variable "Celsius" is not defined. We have to define "Celcius" before using it on line 10 or change its view to "celsius" variable which is defined on line 8.  There is no casting made so after devidiing 9 to 5 we will get int number which is one. To get the appropriate answer on this line we have to change 9 to 9.0 or 5 to 5.0.   There is no closing semicolon at the end of the line. We have to put semicolon after the final bracket on this line. So it will be like ");"  The variable faranheit is not defined. We have to define faranheit variable before using it or change it in the way it is written on the line 10.

Lab 04 Graded Task 2-Is it prohibited in Java to declare a variable inside an IF-statement?
The code I wrote first up was this:         I compiled it and an error occurred:"Variable cannot be declared here" Then I tried this one and it worked:       Is it prohibited in Java to declare a variable inside an IF-statement?If yes, then why?

can't figure out Lab 3 part 2
Hi, I am stuck on lab 3 task 2. I am not sure what the following means "The first arugment is twice the width of the first(or second) ColorImage object while the second argument is the height of the first(or second) ColorImage object." My code so far    Do I use another statement like line 3 for 2nd image but how do I deal with the width and height requirements?

can anybody please explain me how "private int type;" in choice class refer to type i.e., as "choice=new Choice(type)" in player class by writing this.type . i know that if we mention this.type in any method in class it refers instance variable in same class i.e., it refers to "private int type" and how anotherChoice.getR1() in choice class refers "choice =new choice(R1);" in computer class.

Lab 3 Graded Task 4 (Multiply)
I don't understand how the multiply function works... At all. I've studied the ColorImage page a few times, but I still can't figure out how to multiply image1 and image2. At first, I thought I had to use the code "static ColorImage multiply(ColorImage image1, ColorImage image2);", but since it's the method, it's an illegal start of expression. However, I can't figure out another way to multiply image1 with image2. If I simply write "ColorImage multiply(ColorImage image1", the compiler finds a syntax error and says that the coding requires a semicolon after the multiply and won't accept parentheses ("ColorImage multiply;). What am I doing wrong? How do I multiply image1 with image2? Thanks in advance!

java.util.InputMismatchException
Good afternoon, When I download the CourseGrade program and run it, there´s no problem with the compilation and the execution of it. How ever when I try to input the value 100.0 to the program there´s a compile-time error showing the following exception:   Playing with the program I decided to give it a shot not separating the decimal part of the number with "." but with "," and for my surprise the program works just fine. When i run the debugging program I see that even if T tipe 100,0 the actual value that the variable takes is 100.0, and at the end with the instruction IO.output("..." + finalGrade); the result is also displayed as 100.0 How can I solve this issue? I can not find any references to this specific topic on the internet.

Good evening from Indonesia, everyone... As I'm watching the lecture videos in the Memory Allocation, I tried the CourseGrade program exactly what the lecturer input into the program. However, when I tried it with the floating point number (the same value that the lecturer inputs in the video), the program throws an error, in the terminal window saying "java.util.InputMismatchException". I have added the library files in the preferences, and don't change the source code (even deleting and re-extracting the zip file), but still doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? Thanks before!

colorimage class
1.In the project of ColorImageDemo a have 2 doubts:- As per my understandings Canvas and ColorImage are 2 classes but they are not shown in the project ColorImageDemo. And also the two instance variables(i.e canvas and image1) declared in the class ColorImageDemo are these the object of the class Canvas and ColorImage. 2.If the above point is true i.e Canvas and ColorImage are 2 classes with canvas and image1 as their objects resp.then how could we send image1 which is object of class ColorImage as a parameter to method "canvas.add(image1,xPos,yPos)" which is of different class . Hope that i have made my point clear.

Quadratic equation issue
I set all variable to double (a, b, c, and x) because the default data type for Math.sqrt is also double. When I execute the following code: x = (-b + Math.sqrt( (b   a   a) ); the value of x comes out as NaN. Am I interpreting the formula incorrectly?

Week3Quiz
I believe an error of parameters undefined or not specified would occur. Since there is contradiction in the mathematical operations of the script, confusing the compiler. Even though a double will accept an int as one of the parameters, the compiler will go through the first bloc. q3 may produce a 20 accepting the first bloc, but q4 will produce an error as it will not recognize and int as a double.

Javadoc [ Random.class ]
It sounds stupid but I do not have the slightest idea how I should use the functions in javadoc for returning random ints. I would like to use the ints function but don't know how to call it... What irritates me is the idea of creating a random object first by coding: Random randomObject = new Random(); I identified the right function to get the range from -1 to 1 but I do not know how to apply it to the random object. Or do I have to apply it to a random object? I just don"t see how to use Javadoc here and woulc like to be more specific but I can't without giving information on which functions to use...

I deleted Lab02 project and can't reopen it. HELP!!!!
Hello, everyone. I run into silly situation. Somehow I messed up code in mold provided in Lab02 file quite bad and decided to delete it. I thought - well, I'll just resave it from class and open brand new and fresh. The problem - now BlueJ doesn't let me reopen lately saved Lab02 file. It gives me respond like this: The output directory for the archive being extracted already exists. You must remove the existing directory before you can extract the archive.  What should I remove and from where????? Is it even possible to get new mold Lab02 after deleting it once? Or I'm completely doomed and can stop struggling with this class? :)

Lab 3
I have no idea on where to start and what to do for the first 3 steps. Help!    1. Your Java code should first create a ColorImage object by using the default constructor of the ColorImage class. 2. A Canvas object is then created by calling the Canvas constructor with arguments. The first and second arguments of the constructor are the width and the height of the ColorImage. You can obtain the width and height of a ColorImage by using the getWidth() and getHeight() methods in the ColorImage class. 3.Lastly, display the ColorImage object on the Canvas Object by using the add() method of the Canvas class. The ColorImage object is placed at the top left hand corner of the Canvas Object.

Do not agree with the result.
In Module 02 Graded Problem Task 3, the result of 3 + 6/7 * 4.0 in any c- compiler will be 3 if it is assigned to an integer variable or 3.0 if assigned to a float value. Also, if I run this expression in BlueJ, I have to declare the result variable as double to make the compiler happy else assigning the result to int or float generates error.   I think this particular graded-problem has some shady side to it and should accept 3 or 3.0 as a result since variable promotions specific to Java has not yet been covered by course. The main idea of this exercise is to make students aware of the concept of operator precedence and not variable promotions which differ in meaning from student to student based on their background.

My opinion
I don't think it is a well defined problem, because the objective is not clear stated, the concept "the best way to get to somewhere" may differe based on the needs of who wants to get there, More constraints are necessary to determine what is meant with "the best way to get somewhere"

Not a well defined problem
This is not a well defined problem. I suggest so because the term best way is dependent on airlines and different travelers. The best way to travel for KLM is not the best way to travel for Emirates. Some passengers love direct non stop flights some other passengers love multiple stops. The fact that there are so many different combinations that can all be defined as the "best way" depending on the airline/individual means it is not a well defined problem. 3 + 2 is a well defined problem because it holds under any circumstance or time of the day unlike traveling from Hong Kong to London.

I'm so confused with I/O
I think I don't understant how to ask Java to prompt the user for a number with his keyboard :-/ I understood we used "IO.inputDouble( )" in the CourseGrade program …But neither IO.inputDouble( ) nor IO.output work when I try to use them in my homework. For instance, in Module 2 "Lab02 Math is easy", we are asked to ask the user to input the value of x but even when I reproduce the "IO.inputDouble( )" in BlueJ, it doesn't work, while it works for the CourseGrade program I guess "import comp102x.IO" at the beggining of the class is important... but in the Lab exercise, we are just expressly asked to complete only the body of the method so I don't know if I can use "import comp102x.IO" And I don't understant what does "import comp102x.IO" mean anyway :-/ I am so confused. Please, give me a hand Thank you in advance for your help. Enjoy your week end.

Lab exercises
Hai my question is about the "Check" button which we are using in the lab exercises for the no.of attempts. What if my output is correct in the first attempt itself, if I press the check button will it be submitted for grading. Because it doesn't say anywhere that by clicking the "Check" we are submitting our answers. That's the reason I am clicking on "Check" until I get the "Final Check" button. As you have said in the beginning the "Check" button is creating an ambiguity that whether we are only checking whether the output is correct or else is our answer is submitted for grading. I would like to suggest you is if possible in future please add another button beside the Check and Save buttons as "Submit". So that people will understand and also will be confident that immediately if their answer is correct they have submitted it for grading. Because apart from learning a new language people are also concerned about their grades right?

IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM REPRESENTATION
IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM REPRESENTATION I am not understanding this point fully. "The example of the green and red apples shows the importance of finding the right representation before solving a problem. This could save a lot of time and effort." The problem is that I am not really seeing how changing the color of the apples helps to get to the solution faster. Can you elaborate on how this is works?

Question about Square Apple N program
In the Square Apple N program introduced in Module 02, I am confused on the numbering scheme of the grid. The program asks the user to enter a row number (1 to 3) and a column number (1 to 3). Yet the coordinates of the output of points starts at 0, not 1. Why is there a 0 ? If the size of the grid is 3, I assume this means 3 x 3. Are the rows labeled Row 1, Row 2, Row 3, OR Row 0, Row 1, Row 2? Same question for columns. I would expect the program to ask the user to enter a row number from 0 to 2 (not 1 to 3) so that the output coordinates correspond accordingly. I appreciate any clarification.

Regarding multiplication
In Module 2 Lab 02, we are asked to write a program that takes two numbers as inputs from users and print the output. But we are not taught how to take input from the user !!!. So, what should I do?

Modulus Division
I kept getting -49.25. The operation I used was straight left to right.  Edited by TA. Please do not write the answers for graded questions as it violates the honor code.  I thought I understood modulus as only showing the remainder. I guess I'm not quite sure what modulus does other than show the remainder unlike regular division in Java that truncates the number.

HongKong to London
This is not a well defined problem holistically in the sense that, multiple London(s) and HongKong(s) exist around the world. Yes the Origin and destination is defined/known but other variables are not. Variables such as: Weather, which of the HongKong(s) and London(s).

HONG KONG TO LONDON
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF FINDING THE FASTEST ROUTE FROM HONG KONG TO LONDON IS A WELL DEFINED PROBLEM, BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WHERE GIVEN IN THE INTRODUCTION LESSON. THERE MAY BE MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CITIES NAMED HONG KONG OR LONDON. I THINK THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS COUNTRY, STATE, OR PROVIDENCE IS NEED TO COME TO A CONCLUSION.

Traffic Signals
Right from basic countdown system to sensor system used in traffic signals is the best example of abstraction.
