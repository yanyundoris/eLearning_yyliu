PowerCalculator: what is powerN(0,0) ?
n⁰ is generally 1 ? Except undefined for 0⁰.\nBut as as negative powers shall return 1, I suppose it should return 1 for 0⁰, as well as for the other zero powers.

"Finding the best way to travel from Hong Kong to London" 
I don't think it is a well-defined problem due to the fact there are many different "elements" you would have to figure out. If I go on google maps and lookup the best way to London from Hong Kong. Then, I would have to specify my current location, mode of transportation, and etc. There could be a flight that was only "x" amount of hours, but just to get to the airport could be 4 hours travel time. ETC. The best way to have a well-defined problem would be stating how, when, price, and etc. \n\nJust trying to find the best time to travel to London would be one problem to figure out. If, money wasn't the problem, you could consider any "well-defined" solution wasn't a problem. Because most of us are under the constraint of money as well... This makes our "well-defined" solution a bit different. Also, we must consider: any special needs(physical), time that we would have to "travel," and etc.

Module 5 Array Exercise 
Code segment 1 : For the code to run correctly , a  should have initialized  int[] a = new int[4];\n\nCode segment 2: The output is 3234.\n\nCode segment 3: The code needs  a pair of bracket instead of parenthesis. Also, in the if bracket a[] instead of a().\n\nCode segment 4: The array type is int, but the content of the array has double instead of integer. If all the corrections are made the output is 2.5 as the average.\n\nCode Sample 1: The output is -30.0 because it is the smallest integer in the array.\n\nCode sample 2:  The output value of counter is 6 because there are 5 integers in the array list that is divisible by 2 with a remainder of negative one or positive one and the counter is increase by one which equals 6.\n\nCode sample 3: I am confused about this one.\n\nCode sample 4:  The output is 10 because i is increased and j is decreased and the product is added to some until j is negative which is not true and ten is return as the output. \n\nTO FULLY UNDERSTAND THESE CODE I RAN ALL OF THE CODES AND I USE THE DEBUGGER. I AM CHEATING BUT I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LOOP IS DOING TO RETURN THE VALLUE FOR i and j to be set to sum.\n

Module 02 Graded Problem Task 3
In answering these questions I am not sure if I made an assumption or if I just did not understand what was being asked. I did not see in the instructions for the problems that we were supposed to use integer rules to solve them. In fact the directions talk about using only one decimal place in any answer. In the second equation we are asked to find the value of 2 + 15 / 6 * 4.0. I came up with the answer of 12. 15 / 6 is 2.5. 2.5 * 4.0 is 10 and 10 + 2 is 12. The correct answer as given though is 10 because it drops the decimal from the 15 / 6 to give an answer of 2 instead of 2.5.\n\nDid I miss something in the instructions?

I would like someone to help me. I wrote a code to move the car in any direction. But it did not work because I wrote two loops separate who were united in third one. Like this:\n\n`if (distX >= 0) {\n            for ( int i = 1; i <= distX; i++){\n               ..........................+1;\n              ..........................\n            }\n        }else {\n            for (int i = -1; i >= distX; i--){\n               ........................... -1\n                ...............................\n            }\n        }`\n        \n        if (distY >=0){\n            for (int i = 1; i <= distY; i++){\n                .....................+1\n               .......................\n            }\n        }else {\n            for (int i = -1; i >= distY; i--){\n                .................................. - 1;\n                ..................................\n            }\n\nAnd when I run went once in the x direction, and the second time in the y direction.  So I think have to combine them to work simultaneously in x and y direction. Something like this: \n\n`for(int unu = 1; unu<= numberOfTimes; unu++){\n            if (distX >=0){\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence1; i++){\n                    ............................................... + 1;\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }else {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence1; i++){\n                    ............................................ - 1;\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }`\n        \n            if (distY >=0){\n                for (int i = 1; i <=  distSequence2; i++){\n                    ...............................................+ 1;\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }else {\n                for (int i = 1; i <= distSequence2; i++){\n                    ................................... - 1;\n                    pause (timpu);\n                }\n            }   \n        }\n\nBut I do not know how to calculate  the "*numberOfTimes*" and *distSequence1* and *distSequence2*

Graded problem
I have scored 50%in my first module (still lab 1 has to be provided) , as it was my first graded problem i didnot realise  when i had clicked on check instead of save. Is it necessary that in every module we should score 60 per to get the certificate or is it ok that we can do well in next modules and cover the grades.

Examples of Everday Abstractions
There are quite a few of different abstractions that are used everyday in our life.\n\nAn example would be texting on your phone. Regardless of the language, words or phrases used in a text message, the functionalities remains the same. You want to send a message to a particular person and receive a message from a particular person in a timely manner. That is the main focus behind a text message on your phone. This can also be true with an email.\n\nAnother example could be a heater (during the fall/winter seasons) or an air conditioner (during the spring/summer seasons). The functionalities of the products is to keep you comfortable regardless of the changing temperatures. All of us are not knowledgeable on how these products work but know that as long as it keeps us warm or cool (depending on the season), it is successfully performing its duty.

Poor programming style
The Rock, Paper, Scissors lab should be modified to teach better programming style.  Specifically, the type should be a string "rock", "paper", "scissors".  This would yield readable code.  e.g. pseudocode\n\nif (this  == "rock" and other == "paper") then {return "lose"} else {return "win"}\n\nis much more readable than \n\nif (this  == 0 and other == 1) then {return -1} else {return 1}\n\nThe latter requires extra documentation and is more prone to error.  If a student went to work and wrote the latter they should be sent back after a code review to rewrite the code. \n\nLet's teach the right way from the very start.

Module 04 Graded Problem Task 4
This question asks for the values of a char variable `grade`. It turned out that we need to enter just the letter for the grade, rather than that letter in quotes, so (e.g.) X must be entered instead of 'X'. Am I right, wrong, or just a bit weird for thinking that the value of the variable `grade` is 'X' and not X ?

Dangling else - style question
I get the point that "else" applies to the nearest possible "if", irrespective of indentation. But am I right in thinking that it would be better style to write:\n\n    if p\n        if q\n            // do stuff;\n        else\n            // do other stuff;\n\ninstead of the equivalent\n\n    if p\n        if q\n            // do stuff;\n    else\n        // do other stuff;\n    \nIn other words, do people usually use indentation to help match the "else" to the "if"?

Where does rotation come into it?
When looking at the draw() method, I see it is passed an integer for rotation. Cool, sounds fun, I'm all for a bit of rotation.\n\nWhere I'm getting confused is that I see no way to deal with the rotation when adding the image. canvas.add(image, x, y) doesn't include a parameter for rotation, nor does new ColorImage. I'm not even seeing a setRotation() method anywhere.\n\nCan someone please point to how to deal with this parameter?

missing return statement
I have found I get an error if I do not include a return statement at the end of the compareWith() method. Coming from Python this is VERY strange behaviour to me. But obviously it's a Java thing to force a certain way of writing code. Can anyone send me to a decent explanation of this structure requirement.\n\nOR if you think I'm doing something wildly wrong then do me a solid and help me out here.\n\nThe reason I find it strange is because I have multiple return statements in my code. One for every possible if/else scenario (bad boiler plate solution to the problem). For example\n\n    if(some.variable == some.otherVariable) return true;\n    else if(some.variable > some.otherVariable) return false;\nSo, since I have return statements in there, why is it telling me I'm missing a return statement?\n

As copied in the problem:\nimport comp102x.IO;  \n  \npublic class Quiz1 {\n  \n        private int x;\n\n        public Quiz1(int x) {\n  \n                x = x;\n        }\n\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\n  \n                Quiz1 q1 = new Quiz1(10);\n                IO.outputln(q1.x);\n        }\n}\n\nI would like to ask why the explanation said that the value of x is initialized to be 0 as I see no initialization in the code.

Undefined answer
I believe it doesn't have sufficient information for it to be a well-defined Problem. It lacks the exact detail of which London out of all London's that can be found in the world. . Not enough information to agree on a point, because different people will answer to a different destination.

Hello World
I completed the Hello World lab two times. I completed the program in the compiler per the example and it is indicating no syntax errors. The program appears to work as expected. I completed the same code line verbatim in the assessment and the grader is indicating I may have unpaired curly braces. I do not understand why. Below is what I received from the grader.\n\n>     Compilation Error(s):\n>     [ERROR] class, interface, or enum expected.\n>     Additional Comments:\n>     Your code might have an unpair curly brace.\n>     There might be some other reasons for the compilation error.\n\n

Mod 4 Lab 1 'this.type'
Hi everyone,\n\nI'm working on module 4 lab 1 and I think I got quite far:\n\n    > if(anotherChoice.getType() == ...) {\n    >      if(this.type() == ...) \n    >         return ...;\n    >      else if(this.type() == ...) \n    >         return ...;\n    >      else if(this.type() == ...) \n    >         return ...;}\netc.\n\nHowever, I do not understand why I cannot use this.type. BlueJ cannot find 'symbol - method type()'. Can someone explain to me why it doesn't work and what I should change?\n\nThanks in advance!

I am getting nowhere
I just started the course recently. But the link between the Edx page and Bluej is not working at all for me. How do I open a project? Where do I download it? If I download it into my Bluej folder, I do not find it when I try to work on the project. I finished HTML intermediate succesfully before. It is not like i am computer illiterate. But the mishmash of the course parts here is something I cannot assemble or make sense of. Please. Make the edx page the place to be. Link through directly. That is what works so well. This is what makes people like me just drop the course.

Please help with InputMismatchException
First of all, I have to say that I posted the three Labs and all of them are correct and I got all the points. The problem is that after some tests with several type of data in BlueJ something change and an error happens:\n\n![The code and the error][1]\n\nI have several doubts:\n\n- First of all, where is the problem?\n- And then, is there any way to reset everything in order to be able to start again with the tests? Now I cannot input anything even the same inputs that were working before because the Class stops as soon as it starts (I tried to compile, etc, but to no avail).\n\nI have the same problem now with the others (multiply and cuadratic), and maybe the problem appears when changing to input floats, but if I understood right Double is the right type to float numbers, no matter how big they are.\n\nI don't know. I will really appreciate any advise with this . Thanks in advance.\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14551432245907611.jpg

line 28: The variable currentFloor was declared **final** and so its value can't be **changed or altered**,therefore the value 1 cannot be added to it. \n\nLine 32: Similarly since the variable currentFloor is declared Final,its value cannot be **decremented** this goes against the rule of a variable been declared **final** as that variable in other words is called a **CONSTANT** variable (**i.e cannot be changed**)\n\nLine36: The syntax for declaring a do While statement does not allow a semicolon after the **do** closing brace  instead it has to be after the the closing parenthesis of the **while** condition.\n\nLine 47:since the if statements only have **one statement each to execute**,**This may not be a bug** However it is advisable to use the **else if** statements to make the if statements clearer and easier to follow.\n\nLine 54: We should have (i=0;i<5;i++) and **NOT** (i=0,i<5,i++); because semicolons and not commas are found in between the statements in the parenthesis also, there can be no semicolons after the parenthesis except after the statement to be executed within the for loop curly brackets **{ }**\n

Having problems with the declaration: value not in range. Declaring by: "Choice choice = new Choice(randomInteger);  Pretty sure this isn't correct, but cannot test in bj because of weird compiling errors elsewhere in program. Using three as upper range of random generator because Oracle Doc says it is an exclusive range. Very confused. Do I just need to remove one of the choice's?

MOD 03 Graded Prob Task 3 - Diagram in wrong orientation?
This relates to the diagram in Task 3, where we need to adjust the moveForward method to allow for the orientation of the car. The diagram appears in Task 3A, but is actually being used to justify the 2 formulae we need for Task 3B, such as:\n\nDistance to Move in x Direction = Distance to Move * cos(Angle of Rotation)\n\nThe top left of the image includes an x-y axis to remind us that the positive y direction is down in computer graphics, rather than up as in "normal" mathematics. This means that while in normal maths we measure angles anticlockwise from the positive x axis, in computer graphics we measure them clockwise from the positive x axis. So this diagram has the car at an angle of about -30 degrees. \n\nBut the red arc that shows the angle being measured has the arrowhead at the bottom end. That makes it look like we're measuring from the sloping line of the triangle down to the base, about 30 degrees. We're not. We measuring from the base to the sloping line, and since that is in the negative rotation direction, we get -30 degrees. So the arrowhead should be at the top end or arc, since we measure from the x axis. \n\nBut, if we're trying to make this diagram as clear as possible to those who aren't mathematicians, we shouldn't have chosen to demonstrate it for -30 degrees in the first place. We should chosen a simpler example that stays in the "1st quadrant". Let's use an angle of 30 degrees.\n\nSo, I suggest we should flip the triangle vertically. Make the car travel from top left to bottom right of the screen at 30 degrees to the horizontal. The red arc should start at the horizontal edge of the triangle and arc down to the sloping edge of the triangle, with the arrowhead at the sloping edge.\n\n

Module 05 Graded Problem Task 2
We are asked to evaluate the result of 2 divisions:\n\n>int a = 7;\n>\n>int b = 56;\n>\n>int result1 = 56 / ++a;\n>\n>int result2 = 56 / a++;\n\nI compiled this to check the answers, as I failed this task:\n\n    IO.outputln("b / ++a = " + result1 + ", final value of a = " + a);\n    IO.outputln("b / a++ = " + result1 + ", final value of a = " + a);\n\n - Why do they both divide 56 by 8?\n\nI thought that in the first calculation ++a will add 1 to a (++a) and in the second calculation a++, a would stay the same, as 1 is added after the result is evaluated so "a" will be 7 in the calculation.\n\n - Why do both final values of a give "a" result of 9?\n\nIn the first result I can understand that "a" will have a final value of 9, as a = 8, so ++a = 9\nbut what about the second evaluation?\n\nThanks,\n\nHerman

I have written the code inside:\n\n    public void draw(Canvas canvas, int x, int y, int rotation)\n\nAnd the correct image displays in the correct position inside BlueJ when running testCase 1, 2 and 3 in Lab04GradedTask2\n\nBut after submitting the answer into the grader I get the following result:\n\n> Compilation Test: Passed. \n>\n> Number of Test Case Groups Passed: 0/1\n> \n>     1.3 Test Cases (Passed: 0)\n>         Test method draw of rock with x = 0, y = 0, rotation = 0\n>         Failed because of the following reasons:\n>             the Y position of image (480) is incorrect.\n>         Test method draw of paper with x = 13, y = 29, rotation = 90\n>         Failed because of the following reasons:\n>             the X position of image (0) is incorrect.\n>             the Y position of image (480) is incorrect.\n>             the rotation of image (0) is incorrect.\n>         Test method draw of scissors with x = -98, y = -67, rotation = 450\n>         Failed because of the following reasons:\n>             the X position of image (0) is incorrect.\n>             the Y position of image (480) is incorrect.\n>             the rotation of image (0) is incorrect.\n\nFrom the instructions it looks like the image should always be in the left bottom corner i.e:\n\n - x = left = 0\n - y = 480\n - rotations = nil = 0\n\n**So why does the grader check my image at positions and rotations that would not occur in the program.**\n\nI have changed my code to reflect the x, y and rotation to the variables (x), (y), (rotation) instead of the (0), (480), (0)\n\nand now the grader agrees:\n\n> Compilation Test: Passed.\n>\n> Number of Test Case Groups Passed: 1/1\n>\n>    1.3 Test Cases (Passed: 3)\n\n>        Test method draw of rock with x = 0, y = 0, rotation = 0\n>        Passed because of the following reasons:\n>            the loaded image is rock\n>            the X position of image is correct.\n>            the Y position of image is correct.\n>            the rotation of image is correct.\n>       Test method draw of paper with x = 10, y = 25, rotation = 360\n>       Passed because of the following reasons:\n>            the loaded image is paper\n>            the X position of image is correct.\n>            the Y position of image is correct.\n>            the rotation of image is correct.\n>       Test method draw of scissors with x = -52, y = -10, rotation = 180\n>       Passed because of the following reasons:\n>            the loaded image is scissors\n>            the X position of image is correct.\n>            the Y position of image is correct.\n>            the rotation of image is correct.\n\n

Lab 4 I have several issues
I have been trying this code now for 6 hours or so and I am getting nowhere fast\nHere is my code:\n\n        public int compareWith(Choice anotherChoice)\n    {\n        // write your code after this line\n        if(this.type......)    //player choses rock\n        {\n            if(anotherChoice.getType().......)   //computer choses rock\n                return 0;   //draw\n            else if(anotherC........)  //computer choses paper\n                return -1;  //computer wins\n            else if(anotherC........)  //computer choses scissors\n                return 1;   //player wins\n        }\n        if(thi......)    //player choses paper\n        {\n            if(anotherC.........)   //computer choses rock\n                return 1;   //player wins\n            else if(anotherC..........)  //computer choses paper\n                return 0;  //draw\n            else if(anotherC..........)  //computer choses scissors\n                return -1;   //computer wins\n        }\n        if(thi........)    //player choses scissors\n        {\n            if(anotherC........)   //computer choses rock\n                return -1;   //computer wins\n            else if(anotherC........)  //computer choses paper\n                return 1;  //player wins\n            else if(anotherC........)  //computer choses scissors\n                return 0;   //draw\n        }    \n        //return 0; // this line should be modified/removed upon finishing the implementation of this method\n    }\n\n - Problem 1:\n\nThe code did compile without errors until I deleted the last `return 0:`\n\nBlueJ compiler gave me an error "missing return statement"\n\n - Problem 2:\n\nI do not understand the code in Lab04GradedTask1   \n\n       Choice choice1 = new Choice(0);\n       Choice choice2 = new Choice(2);\n \nHow can I load my results in here to test my code in the Choice class as to me it seems that the variables to be used are declared in choice1 = 0 and choice2 = 2.\n\nDoes that mean that:\n\nplayer chooses (0) i.e.: rock and computer chooses (2) i.e.: scissors.\n\nIf that is so naturally the result will be -1.\n\nHow can I my code from compareWith(Choice anotherChoice) to the Lab04GradedTask1 for testing.\n\nThanks, \n\nHerman\n\n

Mistake in Car2 Demo?
I have been testing the Car2 Demo originally included in Module 03 and have put the if-else statement in the code:\n\n        public void moveForward(int dist)\n    { \n        //From Module 4 (if-else-if, switch)\n        int maxDist = (int) (gasInTank / gasMileage * 100);\n        if (Math.abs(dist) > maxDist)\n        {\n            if (dist < 0) dist = - maxDist;\n            else dist = maxDist;\n            IO.outputln("Not enough gas to complete the trip!");\n        }\n\nI have also added:\n\n    IO.outputln("Distance travelled (Km): " + dist);\n\nIf I create a new car it has some declared variables:\n\n    double gasMileage = 10.0;\n    double gasInTank = 10.0;\n\nSo if I travel 100 Km and use 10 Liters of gas per Km you would expect the Terminal Window to show:\n\n - Distance travelled (Km): 100\n - Amount of gas used: 10.0, gas remained: 0.0\n\nIt shows the distance travelled correct, but surprisingly I get a wrong answer for the gas:\n\n - Amount of gas used: 0.1, gas remained: 9.9\n\nThis would suggest that the `double dist` has the incorrect value assigned to it and as a result `double distKm = dist / 100.0;` gives the wrong distance i.e.: 100 meters instead of 100 Km.\n\nHey I would buy this car!!!\nPerhaps it is a hybrid and moved 99 Km on the battery???\n\nI would just like to know what the declared value of dist really is.

Lab 2 Task 1
Hi,\n\nI'm having trouble just getting by Task 1 on Lab 2. I've searched this forum and looked back at the lecture to no avail.\n\nI currently have the code as:\n\n<!--\npublic static void multiply()\n    {\n        // Please write your code after this line\n        int x = IO.inputInteger();\n        int y = IO.inputInteger();\n        \n        IO.outputln("Enter an integer, x: " + x);\n        IO.outputln("Enter an integer, y: " + y);\n        \n        int result= x*y;\n        IO.outputln("Answer = " + result);\n        \n    }\n-->\n\n>     public static void multiply()\n>     {\n>         // Please write your code after this line\n>         int x = IO.input...\n>         int y = IO.input...\n>         \n>         IO.outputln(...);\n>         IO.outputln(...);\n>         \n>         int result= ...;\n>         IO.outputln(...;\n>         \n>     }\n\n<i>**Staff edited**: Please avoid posting the entire code in the discussion forum as it is against the edX honor code.</i> :)\n\nIt still compiled with no syntax errors, but taking too long to run. I reckon that's not even the correct answer because of that.\n\nI'm not sure how else to do this and any further clarification would be appreciated.\n\nThank you.

It is incorrect that the default constructor of Color Image is not used
What is wrong with the way this object is constructed?\n\n    ColorImage image1 = new ColorImage("A.jpg"); //Create image1 object\n\nIn blueJ it produces the correct result, but when I submit the answer into Lab 03 Graded Task 1, after checking the result is produces: \n\n - It is incorrect that the default constructor of Color Image is not used\n\nThis means my score for task 1 is 0.8/1\n\nHow do I create the object image1 correctly?\nin the ColorImage.html under "Constructor Summary" the syntax is stated as\n\nColorImage(java.lang.String filename)\n\nWhy is it wrong in the ColorImage object, and why does it not produce the same for the canvas object?

It would have been more helpful to expand the description of opening this example program.\nTo just say "Start BlueJ and open the downloaded project" is insufficient instructions to new learners.\nThey should really have been directed to double click the file "package.bluej" which would open the completed solution in BlueJ automatically for them.\n

Abstraction Example
(1) AN ATM machine ,People just go the ATM machine caring only about their pin number and their cards need for transaction.  With little or not thought about how the ATM dispenses out the money with high level of accuracy, How it  is able to check your balances and just a click away and giving you appropriate feed back. All these technicality are Hidden from the Users.  (2) Another simple but basic example of  Abstraction is a Simple KEY AND DOOR. We just  turn the keys to lock once or twice and the same to Unlock without been conscious of how this works. Its simple but still i think its abstraction in very basic form

lab4 task1 comparewith() method
Hii! I am currently on the lab 4 task 1. But I am stuck here. It says to compare "this" value with "anotherChoice" and return 1,0 and -1. I did the same with the following piece of code:-\n\n\n\n     if(anotherChoice<this.type)\n\n        {\n            IO.outputln("1");\n        }\n        else if(anotherChoice>this.type)\n        {\n            IO.outputln("-1");\n        }\n        else if(anotherChoice==this.type)\n        {\n            IO.outputln("0");\n        } \n        return 0;\n\nbut this code giver error that there are "bad operand types for binary operator'<'. and that anotherChoice and this.type are different data types. Then what should i use here as parameters to compare??\nplease help me as i am stuck here for like a week :( Reply soon.

Documentation of Canvas add method misleading?
I've got two separate issues here. I ran into these issues when doing the Lab 4 Task 2, displaying the Rock/Paper/Scissors image.\n\nI'm using the first add method of the Canvas class, the one with only 1 parameter. That is:\n\npublic void add(CanvasObject canvasObject)\n\nI discovered that switching the order of the setX, setY and add statements in my solution makes no difference. That is, I get the same results whether I :\n\n(a) Use the add method to put the CanvasObject on the Canvas, and then use the CanvasObject setX and setY methods to move it to the right spot; or\n\n(b) Use the setX and setY methods first to specify the location, and then use the add method to put it on the Canvas.\n\nThe documentation for the first Canvas add method states: "Adds a canvas object to the canvas at position (0, 0)." If this were true, then (b) above should ignore the setX and setY commands and always place the image at (0,0). It doesn't. I suspect the documentation should something like say: "Adds a Canvas object to the canvas. If the object's x and/or y positions have not been set, they default to zero. That is, if neither has been set the image will be placed at (0,0)"\n\nSecond issue: Where the documentation of the add method refers to "a canvas object", should this be "a CanvasObject object". That is, we're referring to an object of type CanvasObject. This issue occurs multiple times in both add methods.\n

I made the program and test it in BlueJ with all the requirements that are in the exercise, the output is fine, but when I send the code, it says:\n\n"\nCompilation Test: Passed.\nNumber of Test Case Groups Passed: 0/1\n\nSorry! Your program might ask for extra user input or it might not read any user input. Your program code runs longer than we expected. The execution of your program is cancelled. The test result cannot be generated."\n\n1) Do I need to make a main to send the problem (I only complete the body of the method and test it, it goes well in BlueJ with the expected result)?\n\n2) Do I need to use the IO.output to ask for the parameters?\n\nI don't understand what is the problem with the exercise i send.

STAFF The Canvas is too big!
I am working on the Rock-paper-scissors and it is fun. Unfortunately the images for the assignment are very large and so the canvas is necessarily very large too. When the canvas is instantiated either the top or bottom extend beyond the limits of my laptop's display. This prevents access to the minimize-maximize-close buttons or at the very least it is not possible to see the entire canvas to know if everything looks correct. I don't see why it would be necessary to use such large images for the purposes of this assignment? I want to use smaller images, but this would confuse the 'grader'

Branching Switch with a String
Hi HKUST'ers,\n\nIn the video for Branching the graphic showed that the switch could use a string, but in the spoken soundtrack and it's accompanying transcript the string is not mentioned.\n![enter image description here][1]\nI can think of how strings are evaluated by assigning each char to a number, perhaps its Unicode value. So a string could have a numeric equivalent, but the default for that process would be ambiguous. Is the graphic incorrect?\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14527100287453001.png

daily life examples of abstraction.
Over daily life is concenred with a lot of abstraction like a user using pc/laptop know how to use pc/laptop to meet his/her  requirment but doesn't how his/her requirment fulfilled by pc/laptop.\n2.Every person knows How to make a call but  doesn't working  of phone.\nWe all know how to print our document but very few of us know working of printer and many more example are available in daily life where we can abstraction.

STAFF should delete my question after answering it
Hi there,\n\nI am enjoying this course. It is good all the things you cover in the lectures, very conscientious presentations. I previously took the Intro to Java Programming from Carlos III University, but they don't have the following courses posted so I am starting over with Hong Kong U of IT because your following courses are posted now. I put the answer to the quadratic equation problem in an important question I had, so please delete it.\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP102.1x+4T2015/discussion/forum/i4x-HKUSTx-COMP102_1x-course-2015-general/threads/56947360e160f2054d000393\n\nSorry I didn't realize this would posted immediately, so others could see it. Now I have read that I should not have done this so I wish to get my questions answered regarding error checking and significant digits and comments regarding my laziness in using double for everything, and then have you delete the code from my posting.

MODULE 04 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 4  
Hello \n\nI have been trying to understand wht the results are B and F , but not clear yet,\nIf the value of score is 100. the result of 100/10 is 10 then we compare the first case and it matches, so we assihn grade = 'S' , we continue comparing becuase there is no break, when we compare cases 9 and 8 , they don't match so the value is not modified, then tere is a break , and the grade continues to be S . \nSimilar withn 79, when it finds te match the other cases don't match , so why  the value is replaced?\n\nswitch(score/10) {\n\n    case 10: grade = 'S'; \n    case  9: grade = 'A'; \n    case  8: grade = 'B'; break;\n    case  7: grade = 'C'; \n    case  6: grade = 'D'; \n    case  5: grade = 'E'; break;\n    default: grade = 'F';\n}\n\nthanks

setScore Array method example question
I do not understand one part of the setScore method of the Array section of Module 5. Why did we initialize an integer type variable called 'size' that was initialized with a value of 'score.array.length' when in the actual method for loop we never referenced that 'size' variable. We continued to use the 'scoreArray.length' in our for-loop-condition. Was that step necessary? If so, why is it necessary if we did not use that variable throughout the method?\n\n\nPer the lecture, this was the proper method...\n\nExample: setScore method\n\n/*\n *  setScore asks users to enter score for each array element\n*/\n\npublic void setScore( ) {\n\n	//length is a constant instance variable for each array that \n	//gives the number of elements in the array\n	int size = scoreArray.length:\n\n	for( int i = 0;i < scoreArray.length, i++) {\n		IO.output(“Enter score for student” + i + “:”);\n		scoreArray[i] = IO.inputDouble( );\n        }\n}\n

MODULE 02 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 4 answer
I started working on this class very recently and I'm trying to finish it up by the 30th.\nI came across MODULE 02 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 4 and got the answer wrong after first answering the question by saying the result would be "0."

What if the user inputs something other than an integer (i.e. letter, decimal?) \n\n2.  Also do I need to consider the fact that the Primitive Int is restricted -2^31 to 2^31-1?  What if the user enters something outside that range?  \n\n3.

The dashboard on a washing machine.
Think about the washing machines that we use in our every day lives. It can also be a good concept of abstraction. Think of the control panel of the washing machine, its dashboard. The switches and the buttons on it are what that makes the washing machine come to life. The buttons each represent a particular function of the washing machine that it does when we press them. Functions like the spin rates, the temperature, and everything else that a washing machine does. The thing is that we press the buttons for the washing machine to do the function it represents and the machine does. We don't know how the the process is done, how the machine works or we don't care how it is done. All we care about is the output that the machine gives. That is all we care about.

java constructors and methods
Hi everyone,\nI have just finished taking the exam. But while preparing for it, one question kept bugging me. I will use the Canvas class in this course as a starting point for my question. The Canvas class has  methods for \n\n>     increaseRed(int value), \n>     decreaseRed(int value), \n>     increaseGreen(int value)  \n>     decreaseGreen(int value)  \n>     increaseBlue(int value). \n>     decreaseBlue(int value).\n\nInstead of having six methods which are very similar in coding, can we just use one method say, \n\n`\n\n> increaseColor(color Red_Green_orBlue, int value)\n\n`     ? \n\nThe same question applies also to constructors. Am I missing something?\n\n\n

what's the correct identifier??
Lab 02 (Math is Easy)\nI have a problem in the first task...\nI wrote 4 lines. The first 3 ones are correct (I have compiled), but I'm having a problem in the 4th one, where I have to output a message to the screen. This is what I've writen:\n\nint IO.outputln("7*3 equals " + calculated_result);\n\nI guess there is a problem with the identifier, but I can't understand what.

Well Defined question
It's a not a well defined problem because the "best way" is not specific enough. Are you taking about fastest, cheapest, comfortable, shortest, safest. There are different modes of travel between the two cities. Also I think London UK is implied but there are several cities around the world that are also named London.  Also the best time to travel in between the cities may also mean the time of day and/or season of the year.

lab4 task1 comparewith() method
Hii!\nI have a doubt in lab 4 task 1.\nHow can we compare the int value i.e. "this.type" with a paramater of type choice which is "anotherChoice"?\nI wrote this piece of code:-\n\n        if(this.type>anotherChoice)\n        IO.outputln("1");\n        else if(this.type==anotherChoice)\n        IO.outputln("0");\n        else\n        IO.outputln("-1");\n        return type;  \nit says the comparision factors dont have the same type.\nHow do I solve this?\nPlease help me :(

Just passing by the discussion section ...\nAfter saw the video first ideia that come to my mind was to make a simple BarcodeGen,\n not the same as the video.\nThe program asks you a number and then it simple converts it to a barcode.\n\nThough it would give me some work but it's pretty easy.

Lab 05 Bug 
Hi all, I think there's a bug in the Lab 5 code. It can easily be cheated if a player enters the same card twice, that way he can finish the entire game :). \nOr is this how the game was intended to work? \nP.S, one if statement solved the issue for me :). \n        This course is rather fun though. \n        Will there be certificates awarded for this particular course.

Sentence is IO.output and not "IO-output". Hyphen is wrong. \n" should be used instead of simple '\nsemicolon is missing to end the sentence.\nsemicolon is missing in final sentence.

Moore's Law
The professor said that it would take 40 years for a 40 year old computer to do what a computer today can do in a minute. I did my calculation, and arrived on a different answer. Please tell where my calculations or reasoning went wrong:\n\nProcessing Speed doubles during a period of 1.5 years.   --- According to Moore's Law.\n\nSo, in 40 years, 40 / 1.5, i.e., approximately 27 periods of time will occur where the processing speed will double.\n\nHence, if a  40-year-ago computer has a processing speed of 1 unit, then today's computer will have that of 2 ^ 27 units. This comes 134217728 units.\n\nSupposing that we defined our unit of processing speed in such a way that 1 unit will take 1 minute. So, today's computer will take a minute. But 40-year-ago computer will take 134217728 minutes. Therefore time taken by 40-year ago computer is:\n\n= 134217728 minutes\n= 2236962 hours\n= 93267 days\n= 255 years.\n\nPlease tell where I went wrong.

Examples of data abstraction
One example of data abstraction is a pilot in an airplane. Say the airplane has a cockpit that has been designed so that one pilot can fly multiple kinds airplanes without having to be re-trained. An example is the MD-10 and MD-11 airplanes, or the entire Airbus series of planes.\n\nWhen the pilot pushes the throttle and makes movements with the flight yoke, he doesn't need to know what the computer that controls the physical mechanisms on the airplane is doing. He doesn't even need to know which kind of airplane he is in, as the computer has been programmed to give a similar feel and control to different airplanes.\n\nIn this case, data abstraction applies to physical mechanisms, computer mechanisms, and even to airplane type.

data abstraction's example
we all are using internet on our laptop in our daily life for different purposes like office work, e-learning, e-banking, e-shopping and the last but not the least social networking. in all these aspects, we only care about what the operations internet perform without caring about how it will perform these tasks like whatever the internal operations the internet perform from collecting the data to establishing the network frame between different users. \nso this could also be an example of data abstraction in our daily life.\nthank you

Identifiers - awkward phrasing
The text beginning -\n " is a sequence of characters consists of letters from a to z both lower case and upper case the symbols underscore and the dollar sign, can also be used and digits from zero to nine,  except that digits cannot be used as the first character of an identifier."\n\nI suggest that you re-visit and revise the wording at this point in your tutorial.\n\n\n

Improving Performance
In matchingGame assigment, GameBoard.java:\n\nIn the GameBoard() constructor it's written this for loop:\n\n`for (int i = 0; i < MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS; i++) { // Code }`\n\nwhat actually happens when `MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS` is executed ?\n\nWill the following alternative increase the performance of the code:\n\n`for (int i = 0, num_of_cards = MatchingGame.NUMBER_OF_CARDS; i < num_of_cards; i++) { // Code }`

TASK 3B MATH LIBRARY REQUIRED - FIX!!!
In This task we are asked to use the cos(); and sin(); functions that are included in the math library: \n\n> "By using the methods sin and cos in the Java Math class here, write a\n> piece of Java code...\n\nThe problem is that when the problem is graded the code that it uses to grade it does not have the code to include the math library. Therefore my answer is not accepted even though the result works in BlueJ when I include: import static java.lang.Math.*; \n\nThis is what the grader outputs:\n\nGrader interpretation of your code is as follows:\n\n>     import comp102x.IO;\n>     import comp102x.ColorImage;\n>     \n>     public class Car2Task2 {\n>     ...\n>         public void moveForward(int dist) {\n>\n>             // Obtain the current rotation in degrees\n>             int rotationInDegrees  = carImage.getRotation();\n>             // Convert the current rotation from degrees to radians\n>             double rotationInRadians = 0.0;\n>             \n>     	      // Please write your code after this line \n>             double distX = ... * cos(...);         \n>             double distY = ... * sin(...);\n>             \n>             // Move the car in both x and y directions with the correct distances\n>             // Notice that setX() and setY() take int as argument\n>             carImage.setX(carImage.getX() + (int)distX);\n>             carImage.setY(carImage.getY() + (int)distY);\n>     	...\n>         }\n>     ...\n>     }

when testing it tells me \n\nCompilation Test: Passed.\nNumber of Test Case Groups Passed: 0/1\n\n    Test Cases:\n        It is correct that only one Canvas object is created.\n        It is correct that the two instances of ColorImage is found on the Canvas object.\n        It is correct that the two instances of ColorImage are created by the default constructor.\n        The dimension of Canvas object is incorrect. It should be just fit for showing two images side by side.\n\n\n\nand I think  the problem the problem is here (A Canvas object is then created by calling the Canvas constructor with arguments. The first arugment is twice the width of the first(or second) ColorImage object while the second argument is the height of the first(or second) ColorImage object. You can obtain the width and height of a ColorImage by using the getWidth() and getHeight() methods in the ColorImage class.)\n\nbut I do not know how to fix the problem or do these argument .\n\nany help please!

Null Pointer Exception when running Lab04GradedTask3
Greetings.\n\nHaving a problem with “Lab 04 Graded Task 3”.  This is where we allow the “computer” instance to make a rock/paper/scissors choice, and then the test code (class Lab04GradedTask3) tries to print out the resulting choice. \n\nI get a “java.lang.NullPointerException” error on the\n\n       int result = computer.getChoice().getType();\n\nstatement.\n\nWithin the makeChoice method, I have the following.  The lines that are commented out is my test code.  I can retrieve the correct answer “choice.getType()” within my test code in makeChoice, but the system generates a Null Pointer Exception when it tries to do essentially the same thing from the testcase1 code.\n\n        Random randomObject = new Random();\n        int i = randomObject.nextInt (...);\n //       IO.outputln("Random#: " + i);\n\n        Choice choice = new .....\n\n //       int j = choice.getType();\n\n //       IO.outputln("returned choice: " + j);\n\n================================\n\nHere is the output of class Lab04GradedTask3 with my above, commented-out statements included\n\nMake random choice\n\nExpected: 0, 1 or 2\n\nRandom#: 1\n\nreturned choice: 1\n\nThen, I get the error on the \n       int result = computer.getChoice().getType();\nstatement.\n\nThanks for your help.\n

I used the following code but it gave me the error mentioned above.\n\n    double rotationsInRadians = (carImage.getX()* Math.PI)/180; \n\n    carImage.setX(carImage.getX() + dist);\n\n    double distKm = dist / 100.0;\n    double setX = (carImage.getX() + (int)dist);\n    double setY = (carImage.getY() + (int)dist);\n

Graded Problem: Car2
Why did the staff made a whole new method **Car2Demo()** for creating the Canvas ? why didn't they initialize the Canvas in the constructors or maybe called this method **Car2Demo()** from within each constructor ?\n\nAnother question, why **distX** should be equal to distance to move * cos(AngleInRadians) ? shouldn't it be just distance moved ?

Module 03: Graded Problem: Car2
In the moveForward() method, it's calculating **gasUsed** based on **distkm** which is calculated based on the parameter **dist**, but if the user entered **dist** value as a negative number (moving backward), the variable **gasUsed** will end up being a negative value and so the instance variable **gasInTank** will increase which is not logical.\nSo I think that it should be:\n\n`double distkm = Math.abs(dist) / 100.0;`

data abstraction
The best example for abstraction concept is ATM machines.ATM machines have both software and hardware aspects.We are much concerned about withdrawing money by pressing the buttons in the Console but what happens after pressing the respective buttons is not of our concern.We are more cautious about the functioning of a feature in an  expected way rather focusing on its implementation part. that's where the abstraction begins ..(hiding the implementation details)

Input function for integers
"IO.inputDouble" is frequently found for getting a float type input.\nDo you have a similar function for integers?\n\nMany thanks in advance.

Lab 04 Graded Task 2-Is it prohibited in Java to declare a variable inside an IF-statement?
The code I wrote first up was this:\n\n        if(type==0)\n        ColorImage choiceImage = new ColorImage("...");\n        else if(type==1)\n        ColorImage choiceImage = ...;\n        else\n        ColorImage choiceImage = ...;\n        choiceImage....\n        choiceImage....\n        choiceImage.setRotation....;\n        canvas.add(choiceImage);\nI compiled it and an error occurred:"Variable cannot be declared here"\n\nThen I tried this one and it worked:\n\n        ColorImage choiceImage;\n        if(type==0)\n        choiceImage = ...;\n        else if(type==1)\n        choiceImage = new ColorImage....;\n        else\n        choiceImage = new ...;\n        choiceImage.setX(....);\n        choiceImage....;\n        choiceImage....;\n        canvas.add(choiceImage);\n\nIs it prohibited in Java to declare a variable inside an IF-statement?If yes, then why?\n\n*Edited by TAC, please avoid to write full code on board*

can't figure out Lab 3 part 2 
Hi, I am stuck on lab 3 task 2. I am not sure what the following means\n"The first arugment is twice the width of the first(or second) ColorImage object while the second argument is the height of the first(or second) ColorImage object."\nMy code so far\n\n>     1) ColorImage image1=new ColorImage();\n>     2) ColorImage image2=new ColorImage();\n>     3) Canvas canvas=new Canvas (image1.getWidth(), image1.getHeight());\n\nDo I use another statement like line 3 for 2nd image but how do I deal with the width and height requirements?  \n

can anybody please explain me how "private int type;" in choice class refer to type i.e., as "choice=new Choice(type)" in player class by writing this.type . i know that if we mention this.type in any method in class  it refers instance variable in same class i.e., it refers to "private int type" and how anotherChoice.getR1() in choice class refers "choice =new choice(R1);" in computer class.

Abstraction Example
`enter code here`An example of data abstraction in everyday life is in the respiratory system. Humans are more interested in breathing, rather than "how" they are breathing. We generally don't focus on the mechanism of the lungs and the whole system.

Lab 02 - Math is Easy
Greetings everyone,\n\nI am having a difficult time understanding the error in my code.  Please note that the code is correctly placed, (in the editor).  My error message specifically says "method inputInteger in class comp102x.IO cannot be applied to given types required: no arguments; found: java.lang.String; reason:actual and formal argument lists differ in length".  This error occurs at my very first statement.  I appreciate any feedback and good luck to everyone during our learning experience! Please note that each statement isn't separated by an entire line, this is just for clarity for this post.  In the editor I did it proper, single-spaced.\n\n int x = IO.inputInteger("Enter an integer, x: ");\n\n int y = IO.inputInteger("Enter an integer, y: ");\n\n int calculated_result = x * y;\n\n IO.output("Answer =" + calculated_result);

There are many examples in our real time; vehicles we use to travel and mobile phones we use to talk,Air Conditioners,refrigerators and so on. All we bother about is whether they work properly or not ,when we try to operate them. But not what is happening internally when we use or power on them.

Curiousity of Week3Quiz code?
Good evening everyone...\n\nIn the week 3 materials, in the General Structure part, there's a problem set; in the end of the code of the problem set, why we use the IO.outputln(q1.x), and not IO.outputln(q1) only? Thanks in advance.\n\nThis is the code extracted directly from the task:\n\nimport comp102x.IO;\n\npublic class Week3Quiz\n{\n    \nprivate double x;\n   \n    public Week3Quiz(int i, double d) {\n        x = i + d;\n    }\n   \n    public Week3Quiz(double d, int i) {\n        x = i - d;\n    }\n   \n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n   \n        Week3Quiz q1 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10);\n        Week3Quiz q2 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10.0);\n       \n        IO.outputln(q1.x); // statement 1\n        IO.outputln(q2.x); // statement 2\n    }\n}

inside the compareWith method i have initialized an integer z, the value of z should depend on the result of comparison between type and anotherChoice and the method returns z at the end. The value of z is not always correct and i don't know why\n\n>     int z=3; at the 1st line of the method\n>     //some conditions\n>     if((this.type==2)&&(anotherChoice.getType()==0))\n>     z=-1;\n\nthe problem is that in the above case the method returns 3 instead of -1 and i can't figure out why, any help plz

Lab 3 Graded Task 4 (Multiply)
I don't understand how the multiply function works... At all. I've studied the ColorImage page a few times, but I still can't figure out how to multiply image1 and image2. At first, I thought I had to use the code "static ColorImage multiply(ColorImage image1, ColorImage image2);", but since it's the method, it's an illegal start of expression. However, I can't figure out another way to multiply image1 with image2. If I simply write "ColorImage multiply(ColorImage image1", the compiler finds a syntax error and says that the coding requires a semicolon after the multiply and won't accept parentheses ("ColorImage multiply;). What am I doing wrong? How do I multiply image1 with image2? Thanks in advance!

java.util.InputMismatchException
Good afternoon, When I download the CourseGrade program and run it, there´s no problem with the compilation and the execution of it. How ever when I try to input the value 100.0 to the program there´s a compile-time error showing the following exception:\n\njava.util.InputMismatchException:\nnull (in java.util.Scanner)\n\nPlaying with the program I decided to give it a shot not separating the decimal part of the number with "." but with "," and for my surprise the program works just fine. When i run the debugging program I see that even if T tipe 100,0 the actual value that the variable takes is 100.0, and at the end with the instruction IO.output("..." + finalGrade); the result is also displayed as 100.0\n\nHow can I solve this issue? I can not find any references to this specific topic on the internet.

CourseGrade doesn't run?
Good evening from Indonesia, everyone...\n\nAs I'm watching the lecture videos in the Memory Allocation, I tried the CourseGrade program exactly what the lecturer input into the program. However, when I tried it with the floating point number (the same value that the lecturer inputs in the video), the program throws an error, in the terminal window saying "java.util.InputMismatchException". I have added the library files in the preferences, and don't change the source code (even deleting and re-extracting the zip file), but still doesn't work. What am I doing wrong? Thanks before!\n

Scholarships
I feel the presence of abstraction, when an awardee of a scholarship does not really care about the source of the funds.. the only thing the awardee worries about is to maintain a certain CGPa, then hands akimbo and wait for the annual stipend.. #Can you relate?? We don't really care about where the funds come from.

lab3 object declaration [task 3]
In lectures it's been told that objects are initiated using constructor so why is it that in "lab3 graded task3" the third ColorImage object is asked to be created by using the add() method of the ColorImage class and not by constructor.\n

colorimage class
![enter image description here][1]\n\n1.In the project of ColorImageDemo a have 2 doubts:-\nAs per my understandings Canvas and ColorImage are 2 classes but they are not shown in the project ColorImageDemo. And also the two instance variables(i.e canvas and image1) declared in the class ColorImageDemo are these the object of the class Canvas and ColorImage.\n\n2.If the above point is true i.e Canvas and ColorImage are 2 classes with canvas and image1 as their objects resp.then how could we send image1 which is object of class ColorImage as a parameter to method "canvas.add(image1,xPos,yPos)" which is of different class .\nHope that i have made my point clear.\n\n\n  [

Lab 04 Grade Task 2
I have completed all three tasks and my code works perfectly. I can play the game without any problems. Tasks 1 and 3 were graded as correct.\n\nHowever the grader is giving me a score of 0 and returning the following message for Task 2:\n\n"Failed because exception (java.lang.IllegalArgumentException) is encountered. Your code might not instantiate object properly."\n\nMy method works perfectly using the unit test method. I even added additional tests. As far as I am concerned I have carried out all instantiations. The code also compiles without error in BlueJ.\n\nI don't want to paste my code here but some guidance on how to sort this out would be appreciated.

Quadratic equation issue
I set all variable to double (a, b, c, and x) because the default data type for Math.sqrt is also double. When I execute the following code:\n\nx = (-b + Math.sqrt( (b * b) - (4 * a * c) ) ) / (2 * a) ); the value of x comes out as NaN. Am I interpreting the formula incorrectly?

Week3Quiz
I believe an error of parameters undefined or not specified would occur. Since there is contradiction in the mathematical operations of the script, confusing the compiler.\nEven though a double will accept an int as one of the parameters, the compiler will go through the first bloc. q3 may produce a 20 accepting the first bloc, but q4 will produce an error as it will not recognize and int as a double.\n\n>     Week3Quiz q3 = new Week3Quiz(10.0, 10.0);\n>     Week3Quiz q4 = new Week3Quiz(10, 10);

Javadoc [ Random.class ]
It sounds stupid but I do not have the slightest idea how I should use the functions in javadoc for returning random ints. I would like to use the ints function but don't know how to call it...\n\nWhat irritates me is the idea of creating a random object first by coding: \n\nRandom randomObject = new Random();\n\nI identified the right function to get the range from -1 to 1 but I do not know how to apply it to the random object. Or do I have to apply it to a random object? I just don"t see how to use Javadoc here and woulc like to be more specific but I can't without giving information on which functions to use...

Hello, everyone. I run into silly situation. Somehow I messed up code in mold provided in Lab02 file quite bad and decided to delete it. I thought - well, I'll just resave it from class and open brand new and fresh. The problem - now BlueJ doesn't let me reopen lately saved Lab02 file. It gives me respond like this:\nThe output directory for the archive being extracted already exists. You must remove the existing directory before you can extract the archive.\nC:\Users\...\Downloads\COMP 102x Lab02\n\nWhat should I remove and from where?????

Every problem is a well defined. In my view ,anyone who is defining a problem with a constraints such as fastest route,cheapest way etc then what's the need for us to solve it if he's going to define in a lucid manner.It's our way of perception,taking  the problem in a definite manner.

Lab 3 
I have no idea on where to start and what to do for the first 3 steps. Help!\n\nDescription\n\nIn this lab exercise, you are tasked to write a piece of Java code to load an image and display it on a canvas.\n\nInstructions\n\n    1. Your Java code should first create a ColorImage object by using the default constructor of the ColorImage class.\n    2. A Canvas object is then created by calling the Canvas constructor with arguments. The first and second arguments of the constructor are the width and the height of the ColorImage. You can obtain the width and height of a ColorImage by using the getWidth() and getHeight() methods in the ColorImage class.\n    3.Lastly, display the ColorImage object on the Canvas Object by using the add() method of the Canvas class. The ColorImage object is placed at the top left hand corner of the Canvas Object.\n\n

One silly yet simple doubt on Constructors and Methods
Hi,\n\nSo I just saw the tutorial on Constructors and methods in module 3. I have a doubt (I know it's a silly one so please forgive me for that) but how do we identify between constructors and methods. For ex:\n\n>     ****** This is a constructor ****\n>\n>     public Car(String name) {   // Constructor takes a name as argument\n>             owner = name;\n>     }\n>\n>     **********************************\n>\n>\n>     ****** This is a method ******\n>\n>     public void moveCar(int dist) { \n>             odometer = odometer + Math.abs(dist);\n>             IO.outputln(owner + "'s car has moved " + dist + " units."); \n>     }\n>\n>     *******************************\n\nI mean both starts with public and the only difference I can see is the use of "void" or "int" in methods after "public". Is this the difference or there's something else that I should know of?\n\nThanks and regards,\nRishav Raj

Do not agree with the result.
In Module 02 Graded Problem Task 3, the result of 3 + 6/7 * 4.0 in any c- compiler will be 3 if it is assigned to an integer variable or 3.0 if assigned to a float value.\n\nAlso, if I run this expression in BlueJ, I have to declare the result variable as double to make the compiler happy else assigning the result to int or float generates error.\ndouble RetVal;\nRetVal = 3+6/7*4.0;\n\nI think this particular graded-problem has some shady side to it and should accept 3 or 3.0 as a result since variable promotions specific to Java has not yet been covered by course. The main idea of this exercise is to make students aware of the concept of operator precedence and not variable promotions which differ in meaning from student to student based on their background.

Very confused about this task. \n\n[Staff edited: please avoid posting your entire code here. :)]\n\nThis is what I have for step 2 and 3. Not sure if it's right, but I am not sure how I should set up the Canvas with setX(), setY() and setRotation() by using the ColorImage method. I always get a system error saying - variable Canvas is already defined.   \n\nIt'd be great if someone could help answer this question!

My opinion
I don't think it is a well defined problem, because the objective is not clear stated, the concept "the best way to get to somewhere" may differe based on the needs of who wants to get there, More constraints are necessary to determine what is meant with "the best way to get somewhere"

ColorImage Example
Two Questions:\n\n1) How is it that we are able to run anything without explicitly typing "public static void main(String[] args)"?\n\n2) I tried this program with images from my desktop, but only got a black-and-white version of the picture. Anyone know why this could be? It worked just fine with the helix, and I even tried changing the extensions on my own images to .png.

Not a well defined problem
This is not a well defined problem. I suggest so because the term best way is dependent on airlines and different travelers. The best way to travel for KLM is not the best way to travel for Emirates. Some passengers love direct non stop flights some other passengers love multiple stops. The fact that there are so many different combinations that can all be defined as the "best way" depending on the airline/individual means it is not a well defined problem. 3 + 2 is a well defined problem because it holds under any circumstance or time of the day unlike traveling from Hong Kong to London.

I'm so confused with I/O 
Hi all,\n\nI think I don't understant how to ask Java to prompt the user for a number with his keyboard :-/\n\nI understood we used "IO.inputDouble( )" in the CourseGrade program\n…But neither IO.inputDouble( ) nor IO.output work when I try to use them in my homework.\nFor instance, in Module 2 "Lab02 Math is easy", we are asked to ask the user to input the value of x but even when I reproduce the "IO.inputDouble( )" in BlueJ, it doesn't work, while it works for the CourseGrade program\n\nI guess "import comp102x.IO" at the beggining of the class is important... but in the Lab exercise, we are just expressly asked to complete only the body of the method so I don't know if I can use "import comp102x.IO" \nAnd I don't understant what does "import comp102x.IO" mean anyway :-/ \n\nI am so confused. Please, give me a hand\n\nThank you in advance for your help. Enjoy your week end.\n\nRalph

Lab exercises
Hai my question is about the "Check" button which we are using in the lab exercises for the no.of attempts. What if my output is correct in the first attempt itself, if I press the check button will it be submitted for grading. Because it doesn't say anywhere that by clicking the "Check" we are submitting our answers. That's the reason I am clicking on "Check" until I get the "Final Check" button. \n\nAs you have said in the beginning the "Check" button is creating an ambiguity that whether we are only checking whether the output is correct or else is our answer is submitted for grading. \n\nI would like to suggest you is if possible in future please add another button beside the Check and Save buttons as "Submit". So that people will  understand and also will be confident that immediately if their answer is correct they have submitted it for grading. Because apart from learning a new language people are also concerned about their grades right?

Module 03 Practice Problems > CLASSES AND OBJECTS >\n\nThe first option sentence says:\n\n"A class can only has either fields or methods but not both."\n\nI believe they meant to say\n\n"A class can only **have** either fields or methods but not both."

Data Abstraction
The vehicles, ATM machine used for transferring money are the example of data abstraction as in ATM we only care about the money transfer not about how that transfer is to be done.This is what data abstraction is all about, in it our concern is what is to be done and how it is done is not our point of concern.

IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM REPRESENTATION
IMPORTANCE OF PROBLEM REPRESENTATION\n\nI am not understanding this point fully.\n\n"The example of the green and red apples shows the importance of finding the right representation before solving a problem. This could save a lot of time and effort."\n\nThe problem is that I am not really seeing how changing the color of the apples helps to get to the solution faster. Can you elaborate on how this is works? \nThanks, Kim\n

Question about Square Apple N program
In the Square Apple N program introduced in Module 02,  I am confused on the numbering scheme of the grid.\nThe program asks the user to enter a row number (1 to 3) and a column number (1 to 3).\nYet the coordinates of the output of points starts at 0, not 1.\n\nWhy is there a 0 ?  If the size of the grid is 3, I assume this means 3 x 3.  Are the rows labeled Row 1, Row 2, Row 3, OR Row 0, Row 1, Row 2?  Same question for columns.\n\nI would expect the program to ask the user to enter a row number from 0 to 2 (not 1 to 3) so that the output coordinates correspond accordingly.\n\nI appreciate any clarification.

Regarding multiplication
In Module 2 Lab 02, we are asked to write a program that takes two numbers as inputs from users and print the output. But we are not taught how to take input from the user !!!. So, what should I do?

Modulus Division
For MODULE 02 GRADED PROBLEM TASK 3 Question 1 asks "3 % 4 - 10 * 5"\n\nI kept getting -49.25.  The operation I used was straight left to right.\n\n**Edited by TA. Please do not write the answers for graded questions as it violates the honor code.**\n\nI thought I understood modulus as only showing the remainder.\nI guess I'm not quite sure what modulus does other than show the remainder unlike regular division in Java that truncates the number.\n\nThanks,\nTanner Richey

HongKong to London
This is not a well defined problem holistically in the sense that, multiple London(s) and HongKong(s) exist around the world. \nYes the Origin and destination is defined/known but other variables are not. Variables such as: Weather, which of the HongKong(s) and London(s).

HONG KONG TO LONDON
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEM OF FINDING THE FASTEST ROUTE FROM HONG KONG TO LONDON IS A WELL DEFINED PROBLEM, BECAUSE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WHERE GIVEN IN THE INTRODUCTION LESSON. THERE MAY BE MANY COUNTRIES THAT HAVE CITIES NAMED HONG KONG OR LONDON. I THINK THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS COUNTRY, STATE, OR PROVIDENCE IS NEED TO COME TO A CONCLUSION.
