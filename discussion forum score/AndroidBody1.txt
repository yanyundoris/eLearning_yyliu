Hi Sir Jogesh and Admin Staff,\n\nOnce again, requesting for your permission to PLEASE continue to provide access to these course materials (Video and Textual Instructions, Assignments, etc.). Work schedules is just way too busy to keep up (i work two jobs). An archived version of some sort would be extremely helpful. \n\nThank you very much for your consideration.\n\nRespectfully yours,\nSujirou\n\n

Wait a little bit. No one still get it. We are all waiting it. True.
55e5a8489714b09e52000d69
Week 5 peer review was due September 3rd. Add 2 weeks, so certificates will be available sometime around September 17th.

i am also facing the same problem when they will provide it ......filling confused \n
55d2064ab30d846a86003401
Hello Mr. Muppala and Staff, Due to the very busy nature of my schedule (i work two jobs), I only came across this course offering just a couple of weeks ago from my email and wasn't even able to complete it. Now, I get this notice in my email that it's about to close out. Will there still be access to maybe at least the course lectures? Some kind of "archived version" of this course. I find the instructions very very clear and precise which is very difficult to find on the web these days. Let alone finding one in a very prestigious institution as yours. Please continue to allow access to the course materials/lectures as well as discussions for us who are too unfortunate to be able to keep up with the implemented schedules. It will be of great help and your response is very deeply appreciated.\n\nMuch respect, Jiro

Where is Honor Code certificate?\n\nI can't find a certificate on my dashboard please help me out of it.\n\n
55f471269714b0798b001663
done thanks 
55f2839001772bd72100153e
It takes time to review the records and prepare the certificates. I believe this process is done manually, at least for the verified certificates. This has been the case in every course I have taken, both on edX and Coursera. Be patient.
55e5a8489714b09e52000d69
it's been more than 2 weeks now.\nwhen we will get certificate???
55e59aa801772bd721000d1d
Do not worry,You may submit all assignments when they open the course again in a short time...
55f2839001772bd72100153e
I hope so... But it is really time wasting and making us waiting for no reason until that time, however we already finished all assignments almost 2 weeks ago. Where is our certificate to who deserved it ?!?.  
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I Would like to thank Mr. Jogesh and those who worked behind the scenes to develop this excellent starter course for Android programming. I will never think you enough. I now know the basics and can tackle advanced courses and/or complete Android books.\n\nThanks again.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Tons and tons of thanks to you and your team Sir for providing such course.Well for people like us in India its some what difficult to find such guidance and tutorial and that also at our ease,and in such time you provided such a quality course,too lucky we are :-) .You have really done a great job. My whole hearted request to you and edx is that you please keep providing such courses on android and also include as much content as you can Sir! And after all we all love edx which is a great place to learn,and after this tutorial we even started loving HKUST. Please keep providing such android courses Sir.Hope you'll be back very soon with some more interesting android courses because people look for android courses more than any other courses. Thanks a lot once again Sir!

Hi. I am also in the same case. I  have completed the course with 73% grade but I did not find my certificate.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Absolutely loved the course! I have been looking to get into Android development for a while now and bought a few self tutor books as well but this course did it for me! I now have the confidence and the knowledge to move on to bigger apps!

You're welcome! Now you see that LogCat looks unreadable at first, but it will often tell you exactly where your error lies, right down to the line number in your file. \n\nBTW, to turn on line numbers in the editor you can find the "Show line numbers" checkbox under:\n\nAndroid Studio > Preferences > Editor > General > Appearance
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
You are right sir. That was the problem and as i have corrected it now the app is running as expected.\ni dint know the the onSizeCchanged function is called before the drawgame() function..\n\ni really appreciate your effort sir. thankyou very much..\n\nit was great meeting you!\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I enjoyed this course a lot. I took this course to get an idea of what is involved in developing an android app and now after completing this course, I feel like I am ready to develop professional android apps.
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
I see a problem. In the LogCat, about 4 lines down from the top:\n\n    at java.util.ArrayList.get(ArrayList.java:311) at game.media304.bubblebum.DrawView.onSizeChanged(DrawView.java:55)\n\nThe error is not in drawgame(), it is in onSizeChanged(), in the loop:\n\n    for (i = 0; i < bubrank; i++) {\n        bub1.get(i).setbound(0, 0, width, hieght);            \n    }\n\nThe problem is that onSizeChanged is a "callback" method - it is called by the system without your knowledge before you have called drawgame() - the ArrayList has not been filled yet. You need to do what the professor did in the Shooting game:\n\n    for (i = 0; i < bub1.size(); i++) {\n        bub1.get(i).setbound(0, 0, width, hieght);            \n    }

Let's see the LogCat output for a crash.
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
Yes!!! if i use add() function inside the constructor objects are added to the arraylist... but when i do the same inside draw view. out of bound exception occures and the size  of array list is shown to be zero.
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
Does it still work inside the constructor?
55e993359714b03b960011a3
You know you qualify when you score at least 60% of total score
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
This is a very interesting course. I learned a lot. The lectures are easy to follow and assignments are very easy when you watch all the videos and do the exercises.\n\nI wanted to ask when will the honor code certificates be available.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Having previously struggled with other online Android courses, I really enjoyed this one. I hope there will be follow-up courses.\n\nThank you,\nSean
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
sorry sir. I have tried that.. but that is not the problem it seems.\n\ni have updated the question  please take a look.\n\ni certainly appreciate the effort\n\nthank you...
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
I see a problem. Near the top of the class DrawView you have:\n\n    ArrayList bub1;\n\nbut inside the constructor you have:\n\n    bub1 = new ArrayList<bubble1>();    \n\nThe first statement should be:\n\n    ArrayList<bubble1> bub1;\n\nIf you look again at the Shooting Game program you'll see the same pattern.\n         
55ec339b9714b0c42d0011bb
i have editted the post like you suggested pls help me ..... thankyou.\n\nthe problem is basically  that i am triying to add to an arraylist but when i do it inside the drawView. there is no error initiallly but the program stopes unfortunatly and does not run in mobile. and the log cat shows out of bound exeption with size = 0. \non the other hand if i replace the add function inside the constructer of DrawView class the elements gets added.
55ebd8dd01772b2feb00113e
Hopefully it will be ready within couple of days. But edX didn't confirm any specific date.

A big thank you to Prof. Joggesh Muppala and team for the planning and execution of this course. It has been a good five weeks of learning for me, and I'm sure it would be the same for many others too. The lectures and course content were indeed helpful. Thank you once again!!

Respected Dr.Muppala and The Staff,\n\nHi,\n\nFirst of all i am really very thankful to Dr.Muppala and the staff for their great efforts. I really enjoyed the course and i have learned alot.\n\nThe course is very nicely designed for the beginners. The lecturers and other materials are very helpful for understanding the Android Studio. \n\nBest Regards,\n\n-Wazir \n\n \n\n 
55e8423901772b01c200104d
There is no special setting that you need to change in the phone, it is just one more normal webpage that you are trying to access.\n\nJust to be sure, when you said you used this address only, on your phone's browser don't put just   192.168.1.7   , but 192.168.1.7:3000/people  (or even 192.168.1.7:3000 , which should give you a page only  {}   ). Because if you don't specify the port, the browser tries port 80 and cannot get anything. If you did this correctly, then:\n\n\nNo. Maybe your computer's firewall is preventing other devices from connenting to your computer at this port. Try to disable the firewall for a few minutes and again try to open the page in phone's browser. If it works, make sure you enable the firewall again and just add an exception to "open" this port (process depends on the firewall).\n\nIf it doesn't work again, I am not sure what the problem may be. There are a few apps that can help you check a few network related things, but I haven't used any yet so I can't really recommend
55e8423901772b01c200104d
Yes I did that\nI use WiFi network so IP address is not static its dynamic\nI used ipconfig command to get IP address.I used that address only.I used all the instructions.\nWith that IP address URL opens perfectly OK in computers browser but not in phones browser....\nThere it gives connection timed out error or page not found.\nDo I need to enable particular setting in developer option?
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thanks a lot Jogesh for the your efforts for making this course very interesting.
55e8034401772bebe2000fcb
You have to wait a few days / weeks , and then the certificate will appear under the course in your dashboard (at least the Honor Code. I don't know if the other is the same)
55e8423901772b01c200104d
You should not put localhost. Localhost means "this same pc". From your computer, when you try to access localhost it is successful, because it calls the server in that pc, and this is ok.\n\nWhat you have to do is find the local ip address of the computer that you installed the server, and then in the address bar put:\nhttp://<Your machine's IP address>:3000/people\nFor example my pc's local address is 192.168.1.7 ,  so I had to put \n192.168.1.7:3000/people  \n\nThis is for manually accessing it (to test that it works). For the app, you have to change the Server IP in the Constants file, and then use the appropriate url.\n\n\nP.S. From the instructions:\n\nFinding your Machine's IP address\n\nIf you are using a Microsoft Windows based machine, you can use the instructions available at http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-computers-ip-address#1TC=windows-7 to find your machine's IP address.\nOn a Mac, go to System Preferences->Network to find the IP address of your network adapter.\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
To continue what i meant.\nFew people here are asking to extend the course for 10 weeks. But that can be done in the next level of course. i.e. can come up with advanced level of this course.\nBut it is better to have this kind of short duration course (4 or 5 weeks) to give the taste of the subject. If people are interested, then they can go further. If there is only one course of 10 weeks, then few may drop out to register (who are fence sitters like me).
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Jogesh and team, thank you so much for this intro course. You did a great job. I am just complete my degree in computer science. 2D graphics is very helpful for me. I like to learn opengl for android. 
55d2064ab30d846a86003401
I'm just doing it for the well presented free skills and knowledge,\n\nA certificate from here could be had by keeping a record of my attempts at assessments and submitting them the next time the course is run anyway.\n\nThank-you for leaving the information open to those of us who want to learn.\n
55e6a09201772b0c4d000f21
OK, let's see your TODOs.

Which app are you referring to? What changes have you made?
55e6a09201772b0c4d000f21
Its already done in it i still don't know what is causing this. Do u want me to send a screen shot of code?

Thanks for that great course it was excellent! I hope next course will come soon.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
The course was very good.The exercises after every topic help us to understand the topic more clearly and apply it.\nLooking forward to see the advanced course on android app development soon :).

I would like to thank Jogesh mupalla sir ,whole staff behind this course and edx team for their efforts.I have learned a lot from this course and will use this valuable knowledge to develope android apps..\n\n \nOnce again thanks a ton.....\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
This is an excellent platform to study.And It helped me a lot to study new things.It was very easy to study through video tutorials.If internet is available then gaining knowledge is free of cost.Thanks to edx for this chance.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thanks very much for this excellent introduction to programming Android! I found working through the clearly presented exercises really helped me come to grips with this challenging material. A good approach and well done. I hope there will be more courses like this. Once again, thank you!

Both answers do not contain the "people:" part of the JSON string, so I expect they are both false.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Mr. Muppala is a brillant teacher. It was a very good introduction to Android programming. I'm now reading a book about it and everything seems so easy!\n\nThis was my second online course experience. The first one I took while I was 15 yd from an university here in Brazil to learn C. It was great aswell, but back in that time (a loooong time ago) we didn't have all this tecnology. We just changed e-mails with text and assignments. So, I'm very happy to see things evolved for the best.\n\nI surely will take other courses in this platform. It was awesome.\n\nThank you

Go to File > Project Structure.\n\nSelect the app name on left side under Modules.\n\nSelect Default Config.\n\nSelect the Flavors tab.\n\nSet Min Sdk Version and Target SDK Version to your choice.\n\nClick OK.\n\nThe project will now automatically rebuild and display any problems with your new choices. A common problem is that your Min Sdk choice cannot support some of the features required by your app. To fix it, either raise the Min Sdk level, or import supporting libraries, or remove the offending features from your app.

Hii johndoe9007\nYes I have been able to run all the assignments on real device\nBut I have not tried running this assignment on emulator..\nI think problem lies in accessing the local host on my phones browser.(I ignored this part.and telling myself how stupid I am lol)\nI searched on google and followed all the instructions .\nI use WiFi network so there is no issue  as phone's internet and computers internet should be on same network\nJson server runs perfectly OK on computers browser but on phone it is giving timed out error..\n\nBut I will keep trying and will also check this on emulator .thanks for your suggestion...

There will be an announcement, either by e-mail or posted in Course Info above or in your Dashboard, directing you to a link where you can view and download your Certificate. It can take weeks but it is usually much faster.
55e703699714b0044d000f59
This is not an error, you can run the app as it is (assuming there are no other errors).\n\nYou are seeing this because Android Studio is reminding you that it is considered bad practice to put "hard-coded" strings in a layout file. They should be in the strings.xml file, inside the res/values directory. This is a pattern seen in web page coding too, which is to keep the layout separate from the content. \n\nYou can fix this automatically by clicking on the yellow lightbulb, and then clicking on the appropriate element in the pop-up list. This will open a dialog where you enter a "resource name" for your string (for example, button_string) and then click OK. Android studio will then replace the string in the layout file with your resource name, and place the hard-coded string in the strings.xml file, with the resource name. This procedure is known as "extracting a string resource".
55e7052e01772b01c2000f57
Yes, the course is over. It's only 5 weeks long.

To make a new json string, use the gson.toJson method (it's the inverse of the gson.fromJson method). \n\nSee the Gson user manual at: https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Array-Examples\n\nOr just make a json string manually, using the json format:\n\n    {\n      "people": [\n        {\n          "id": 1,\n          "name": "John",\n          "statusMsg": "Imagine all the people ...",\n          "imageURL": "John.png"\n        },\n...\n\n      ]\n    }\n\nTo modify the existing db.json file, use a text editor. Or, write a Java program to output the json string directly to a file.\n\nTo install a different json file into localhost, put the new file into your server directory and issue the command:\n\njson-server --watch YourNewFileName\n\nReview the instructions at:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/93ca675ee54240d79cddc6219556011f/ecb4b170a3fd4d77b2fa8416370190e4/\n

Hi.\nI want to thank you all, promoters, teachers and assistants. I was very curious about this course and you keep me interested all the time.

Thanks a lot for Muppala sir and edx for launching this course.\nInitially i thought the course went fast and could have been extended. But now i am feeling this is the best method (to cover in 5 weeks). The course points to all the required materials. People who are really interested, can then proceed on their own. The first push is what was required and this is the good starting point.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Many thanks to Professor Muppala and the HKUST team on a great course.  I really enjoyed it and learned a lot.  The lecture videos were outstanding - clear, well organized, and easy to follow.  The use of mostly populated project .zip files that we could add to was effective, but the exercises could have been a bit more challenging. You may want to consider providing fewer details and including more TODOs in later exercises to reinforce earlier material and also adding a 1-2 week final project to the syllabus. I hope HKUST / edX offer an advanced course on Android app development in the future.  Well done!

I'm really enjoying this course, even though I have no experience with the Android platform, in JAVA  I am also beginner, but all is explained to be understood. I hope that the introduction to Android, derive more advanced course. Thanks a lot!

Use ArrayList&lt;AndroidGuy&gt;.
55e5e02e01772b2feb000d9b
For 2 AndroidGuys, you can just duplicate some code. If you want more, you can use an ArrayList of AndroidGuys and do some iteration on the list.\n\nStart with 2 AndroidGuys. Look in the file DrawView.java. AndroidGuy is declared as an instance variable near the top of the class:\n\nAndroidGuy androidGuy;\n\nAnd then an instance of AndroidGuy is created in the DrawView constructor:\n\nandroidGuy = new AndroidGuy(Color.RED, mContext);\n\nLater, it is referenced in 2 other methods of the same class: onSizeChanged and drawGameBoard.\n\nAll you have to do is to declare another instance variable:\nAndroidGuy androidGuy2;\n\nand then create it:\nandroidGuy2 = new AndroidGuy(Color.RED, mContext);\n\nand configure it in the onSizeChanged method:\nandroidGuy2.setBounds(0,0,width,height);\n\nAnd finally, repeat the code in the drawGameBoard method, substituting androidGuy2 for androidGuy. Don't forget to remove the bullets that hit androidGuy2.\n

Thanks for organizing this course. I learned a lot about Android and I hope to write my first before the end of the year.\nI think the exercises and assignments are well designed, which is very detail-instructed so that I can complete the exercises and have hands-on experience of using the tools and concepts taught in the course. This also allow students with only basic level of java programming to complete the course.\n\nHowever, many parts of the codes in the assignment are provided and many things are preset. This somehow make the assignments too easy. I suggest more TODO could be included.\n\nMoreover, the course only covers a small part of Android, some important parts such as intent filter, permission, location etc are not included. Therefore I look forward to part II of this course if you are going to offer it.

I'm grateful that this course is held!\n\nI am a Software Engineering student, but I have yet to have any hands-on experience for Android Programming. I learnt a lot throughout this course. \n\nThe only regret would be not being able to submit all coursework on time because I have very tight schedule in week 4 even though I technically passed the course. \n\nI believe there are more to learn, but this is a really good kick-start. I'm very thankful for the effort of the entire team to deal with the students' problems as well as the effort to conduct this comprehensive course in only five weeks.\n\nCheers!

Agreed, requirements should have been at TODOs. What's more, one peer suspected me having made some kind of infringement because I didn't have included these placeholder, error and centercropping functions in my answer! Hah hah, that's human nature I guess ...

I admit that I couldn't perceive the instruction completely. I got the point of using the placeholder image but didn't get that the same image is to be used for error placeholder too.\n\nI went through the [discussion forum][1] and found that we can also put image in some directory and use that. So I chose this option.\n\nI'd also mentioned the same in comments so as to let the reviewer know about it.\n\nLastly in Rubric, it's said that the placeholder is to be taken from the proper directory.\n\nAnyway, you too admit that the peer didn't assess it right though!\n\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/d393bfd089423f69b08b0d8fded8ea84b9ce6727/threads/55e06de201772b2d7000092c

> It is acceptable as long as there is an attempt to:\n\n> load images by the proper path corresponding to the proper contacts.\n\nThey failed that criteria. The rest of the code passes the rubric, though it should be a single chained statement.\n\nHowever, if they posted an image of passing the tests, I would inspect it closely, as their code will almost certainly not pass the tests.
55e4530d9714b01c9d000c18
Peer 1 definitely graded you unfairly, probably due to a misunderstanding. They may have tried to compile the code themselves, which would have failed because they hadn't added those resources. I notice that peer gave you at least 5 zeroes, so perhaps that's their way of accusing you of cheating.\n\nAt the bottom of that page there's a form to "provide feedback on peer assessments". I don't know if it accomplishes anything, but you can try filling that out.\n\nThat said, read the instructions carefully! It does say "Use R.mipmap.ic_launcher for place holder and error place holder".

The extra concatenation might be slower?  Also as **jmuppala** mentioned, by separating out the two, you can have different names for the image file.\n\nIf the image file needed to be updated because the image was copyrighted and the new file had a different name on the server, (you have a stingy admin) then you would have to rewrite the code the way you have programmed it.  By using a second variable all one has to do is update the image name in the json, which is the preferred method.

Just use your web browser first and copy-paste the above url's into it to test.  You should be able to get the JSON from this url: http://localhost:3000/people as well.\n\n\nWhen running the server you see the following output:\n\n>       Resources\n>       http://localhost:3000/people\n>     \n>       Home\n>       http://localhost:3000\n\n"Home" in this case is referring to the "public" folder.

if one image is repeating then you have most likely hardcoded the image name instead of getting the image from the json code that was read in.

Thinking about this further, I wonder if there is a "fiddle" type environment for json?  Or perhaps a public server that would include the code could be setup for this course in a second run so people could try their apps out?  The bandwidth shouldn't be too much of an issue...

***Most computers are not setup as servers.***  \n\nThere could be a list of reasons why your PC is preventing access to it on the network.  The emulator is local to the machine and will not have this issue.  If you are running windows make sure the computer's firewall is setup correctly to allow an outside device to access the web server.  \n\nA correctly setup web server is needed if you are trying to access the content on a different piece of hardware.  **Firewalls, antivirus, router, etc may all block this from happening.**  You will have to keep googling, or binging until you find instructions that help you do this.  The raspberry pi is an affordable way to have a test server setup, and you won't have to worry about opening up security holes on your workstation (laptop/desktop)

I have mixed feelings.  From the standpoint of getting someone who knows java into programming on the android device, the course is a great way to do it.  However, there are a few points to consider:\n\n0. I applaud trying to teach with the android studio on such a scale.  The android studio product however, leaves much to be desired from a polished application and was a constant source of issues for quite a few students.  Some even left the course because there were not enough instructions on how to get setup. A **wiki** might help to control this.\n\n0. I would recommend expanding the introduction period to two weeks(+1 week overall) and creating very detailed installation instructions, going over many of the challenges of the installation process.  I would also place a warning on the requirement and its difficulty.\n\n0. This additional week, 6 instead of 5, will allow for a week of slack time.  I would release the content in the same manner so that each weeks due date gets pushed out to an additional week.  **In other words, the release schedule would follow weeks 1-5, the due dates would follow weeks 2-6.**  In this way if someone has work or life responsibilities that come up they can still catch up and for those who had lots of difficulty setting up their environment it would give another week.\n\n1. By expanding on the course and asking more questions you can be sure that the students are learning the content.  Anyone with good programming experience in Java should have gotten the 100%, unless they had trouble getting their environment to work.  Unfortunately for some new students, they may forget the content or have to continue to play with the system to really learn and commit to memory what was offered.  As a manager I would not consider this course as a certification that someone can program app's.  **There is too much hand holding.**\n\n2. I recommend at least **five questions** instead of two, to test and challenge the students.  Also add a “show answer” section to explain why the choice is correct or not.\n\n3. Add **"extra credit" weekly challenges** in the forum to see if the students really learned.  Encourage them to write an app on their own that does something using what they learned in the current and prior weeks.  Even though these would not be graded, it would allow the students more of a direction in experimenting with what can be done. TA's have done this successfully in other courses like the Java 1 class.  For instance, a challenge could look like the following:\n\n>     Build this:\n>     1. Interface has 2 buttons\n>     2. One button says red, one button says green.\n>     3. Pressing a button changes the background color of the app to the color written on the button.\n>     \n>     Post a screen shot when you are done to let us know that the app works.\n\n\n4. **Encourage the students to try to solve the programming challenges on their own before just copy/pasting the code**.  There is no challenge in pasting a solution.  As an overview of the content, the course did a good job, but it needs to actually challenge the students.  The hardest part of the course was getting android studio to work correctly.\n\n5. If you have time, adding **a brief discussion or a section about creating tests** would be beneficial for the more advanced students.  At least **link** to a resource that can teach more about this functionality for independent study.\n\n7. I recommend **adding a course “project”** that gets built each week as the students do the course.  The project would not have any base code and would require the student to use content covered in the course to construct.  The project would be different then any other code already shown, so the student would be forced to “learn” and apply the knowledge they studied.  I would set the project at **20% of the overall grade** and have it graded similar to what was already done with the peer reviews.  In this way you would also force the students to do well on 4/5 weeks of the material instead of just 3/5 if they wanted to pass.  This would help tell you if the students actually learned the content and set a bar for those who are more advanced to be challenged.  One could still pass the course if they didn’t do the project.  So each week would then be worth 16 points instead of 20.  Again, the course project would have business requirements only and would not provide any code snippets.\n\n8. **Graded quizzes** on the content that are graded would be a nice addition.  Too much of the grade depends on the code submission.  I would keep the current “end of unit challenges” as non graded, but a weekly quiz in addition to the programming might even things out.  It would also help indicate where the students need assistance.\n\nFor what it was, it is a great way to get people started in programming applications for android, who knew how to program already.  It might be a good idea to look at the Java 1 & 2 courses and determine if there are new concepts being taught in this course as far as the core language is concerned.  And then add additional supplements for those concepts, or perhaps a Java 3 course that prepares the student for this android course.\n\nI believe “class in a class” is a topic not covered in either but used in this course.  There should be more time given to the students to explain how to use the debugging.  Things like log4j/jUnit etc might be nice to go over.  I used logging on every assignment to determine what was going on, and to ensure that I was able to produce correct results. Logging also helped me understand the code better.\n\nUse the Java 1 and 2 courses as pre-requisites for anyone who is new to the Java language.\n\nI don’t believe it is enough to just talk about the extra libraries like picasso.  There should be more course work to assist the student in understanding how they work, separate from anything else.  Perhaps a supplement unit to explore the library in more depth so the student gets a better exposure to the content.\n\nAs this is an intro course, for its first run, I congratulate you on putting it together.

In order to continuing learning Android, does anyone recommend a book?\nThanks in advance!
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Good introduction. This course is more about examining the code the teacher has written, and listening to him explain it. Not much to do for the student, weekly exercises don't require a lot of coding. But then again, if you want to cover many topics in short time, you have to resort to this kind of tactic. Coursera's Android course requires the student to do a LOT more work, like 5-10 times more, the code is far less ready written by the teacher and there's a small final project.\n\nThis course is a good addition to check out when you take many courses and look at other online material to learn Android. The more sources, the better! \n\nThank you very much for this course Mr. Muppala.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I like this course very much! It was my first step in Android World and I think is very useful!!\n\nThanks a lot!

Jogesh and Team, Thank you for taking the time in teaching us the introduction to android application development. The way the course is setup is helpful for beginners like me to learn the basics. It certainly made me want to learn more about android development!
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
The course was an excellent mix of practical examples, theory and explanations. \n\nIn a short 5 week course many interesting topics were covered.\n\nThank you very much and if there is a part 2 I will definitely enroll.\n\nI teach high school computer science and I wanted to get a "feel" for Android programming beyond the use of MIT App Inventor and once my students have functional Java skills this type of course material could help them jump into the world of Frameworks and mobile Android app development.\n\nRegards,\nGrant Hutchison\nToronto, Ontario, CANADA

First, a quick intro to Serialization:\n\nSuppose you want to send an object from your Java program to a friend, by e-mail. You could just copy and paste the Java code defining the object, for example:\n\nfriendInfoList = new ArrayList<FriendInfo>();\n\nBut this gives just an empty shell - where are the data?\n\nSerialization is the conversion of an entire object, including its data, into a string representation that can be printed or stored in a file or even e-mailed. Deserialization is the reverse process - it lets you recreate the original object. That's what JSON is for. \n\nProf. Muppala serialized his array of FriendInfo to produce the JSON string he gave to us (using the gson.toJson method). The resulting JSON string was a nested list of keys and values, such as { "people":[ { "id"=1, "name":"John"}, ...\n\nFinally, we recreated friendsInfoList with:\n\n    List<FriendInfo> friendInfoList = null;\n    ...\n    friendInfoList = Arrays.asList(gson.fromJson(infoString, FriendInfo[].class));\n\nSo, to answer your question, the JSON string represents two things: the original array of FriendInfo objects that Prof. Muppala serialized, and the FriendInfo array that was recreated in our app. \n\nMore info at:\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide#TOC-Array-Examples\n

I came into the course a week late, but I was able to get 80% and pass. I think the course assignments were a bit too easy, but I definitely feel that I got a lot out of the course material. I would like to thank the staff for their efforts in getting it published to the edX site.\n\nI think that it is very exciting when you can hook up your own phone to the Android studio and write your app and see results on your phone right away.\n\nI would love to see a more advanced course on this topic.

The 1st peer is correct with regards to the method chaining.  \nBy making three separate calls the behaviour of the application is not as desired.  \n(the first call loads the image, the second resizes the image, the third sets an no longer needed placeholder while re-loading the original image)  \n\nHowever, I think it does pass the rubric as the rubric did not specify it had to be a single call.

This was a great introductory course! I was concerned about the 5 week time being a little too short, but the assignments were fairly trivial. I learned a great deal from the lectures and got from it what I was looking for. It worked well for me that the assignments did not require a lot of time, however, part of me looked for a bit more challenge. Thanks!

I want to express my appreciation about the way this computer programming course is taught.\n\n - First a theoretical overview to the material and explanation.\n - Then a programming example.\n - Then a lab to program it yourself.\n - Finally a test to verify that one grasp the lesson.\n\nI think it's a great method of teaching programming practical skill. Learning the new knowledge by: seeing, reproducing and doing.\n\nI applaud you for this.\n\nThen there's also a problem with the prerequisites of the course. The hardware and disk space requirements for the programming environment are ridiculous. Please try to cut it down so more people are able to do the programming labs.

The code in the example is wrong. In the callback function onListItemClick, you should used position (not id) as index for the string-array. That is why position is and int while id is a long.\n\nHere you have the API for that function: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ListActivity.html#2221665329902034598\n\nThe (long) id is used when using a CursorAdapter instead of an ArrayAdapter.

55de6da201772b0c4d000812
I had the same problems and found something interesting. I also have a "slow" AMD processor, but the problem with the tests and the images is not a timeout (even though I first had a timeout, but solved it restarting the OS), but the fact that you are re-sizing and cropping the android-guy image, and the test is comparing them with original. You can solve this re-arranging the "Picasso commands": .placeholder() and .error() should be written just before .into() for the tests to work properly. That's how I solve it.\n\nPlease, let me know if it helped.

Thank you for the excellent work Mr. Jogesh Muppala and team. Thank you Edx and Hongkong University as well for providing this learning opportunity.\n\nOverall, This was a great introductory course in Android. The instruction videos were superb. When I came across difficult issues, I used the discussion section to gain insight.\n\nAs this was my first exposure to both Android and Java programming I was somewhat struggling to understand whether I was dealing with ADK, SDK or Java difficulties during the first week. After that I resolved the emulator issues and was able to proceed more effectively through the remaining course objectives.\n\nMy suggestion would be to provide more advice the first week in dealing with the very slow emulator response time or using a USB connected device. Once I crossed that hurdle I could concentrate and focus on learning Java and Android.\n\nThank you. I look forward to future courses developed by you and your team.

change localhost with your actual machine ip. \n\nyou can obtain the ip by typing: ipconfing in cmd.
55e1bac09714b04b61000a4f
Did you type http://localhost:3000/people? or http://localhost:3000/?
55e0cc389714b0c42d0009af
It works! Thanks sasabajtl!\n

This was a great course that I would recommend to others that want to get their feet wet with Android development.  The assignments are a good stepping stones for creating more fully featured apps.  My only issue was that the course could have been a little longer (6 - 8 weeks instead) and cover a few extra topics.   
55e2fc1a9714b0e00a000ad7
That is a fail
55e1d1d401772bf714000a66
As I explained in the videos, libraries are a big time savers. These are well-tested and compactly written code. I don't think even I can come up with anything remotely close to beating their performance even if I tried. Believe me, I implemented hand-written code for accessing a server through REST API, then I discovered Retrofit and found it to be lot more straightforward to use. Don't dismiss libraries claiming overhead. Once you are in the field you will learn quickly how to efficiently get things done using libraries.

I agree with many here.\nI liked very much of what I have learned in this course.\n\nIt was my first step in the platform and now I can write apps and evolve more.\nI hope in the future you include something about persistence with SQLITE.\n\nAnd thank you for the nice work Mr. Jogesh Muppala and team, to Edx and Hongkong University for delivering this so good material.\n\nI wish all of you the best and keep up your efforts.\n\ncheers all\n\nSamuel

The Course was very useful for me to develop an in-depth knowledge. Now I’m confident enough to go further with the knowledge acquired. I must admit that forum contains the knowledgebase which is very helpful to get the answers to any kind of query for the beginners. \nAnd last but not the least, I am thankful for the Golden Opportunity provided by Mr. Muppala and staff, and EDX for presenting a complicated study Material in a very interesting manner, which is also easy to understand.\nAlong with networking some insight into handling the database could be of help to the learners. \nThanks to all the Community TAs for their guidance and helpful suggestions. Thanks to all the staff of EDX to make this Course a Grand success. Hope to have an advanced Course on Android Development in near future.\n

I'm just saying that these libraries have overhead associated with them. However, I'm guessing these topics are for advanced course. I really enjoyed this one though ! I hope you come up with a next one a bit more involving ! Thanks !

Thank you Mr. Muppala for this course. I really enjoyed it and learned a lot. Before I started, I knew absolutely nothing about android app developement. Now, I know how to create layouts and views and database support! I'm looking forward to more great courses like this one. Thanks. :)\n\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
i enjoyed learning in this course. there are a lot of new things and approaches i have learned in this course. i thank all the people who made this course.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
The course is great to introduce variety of features for new versions of Android such as multimedia and Material design. However, it is too short to be considered enough to develop skills of writing your own Android apps. In video exercises, explanation of many crucial aspects is just omitted and hence the learner needs to analyse the source code by himself(herself). I should also note extremely weak assignments as they can be made without watching lectures (and some of them can be made even without knowing Android at all).\nNevertheless, I am very grateful to Dr.Muppala for providing this course via EDX for free.\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Fantastic course! A great starting pointing for anyone interested in learning Android Programming. It is concise, clear and  superbly-well taught. A big thank you to all those who made this course possible and hope you carry on with this course. \n\nIt would be great to also have an extended, more-detailed version of this course sometime in the future.\n\nGood Luck to Mr. Jogesh and the Staff of COMP107x

It's a great class which covers a lot of topics, the class is well-prepared to allow students to follow on the material without stuck at unrelated topic. Mr. Muppala delivered the material clearly. Thanks
55e1d1d401772bf714000a66
Why not go all the way and just reimplement Android platform itself? Then you will end up learning everything you need to know :-) After all, Android framework is itself a library!

My explanation included the missing syntax, but it got deleted in the answer. The missing part is the "uses-permission" string, preceded by a slash, included between a smaller than and a greater then sign.

I would not give the point and let the student worry about it. They are either cheating, or just really sloppy, neither of which deserves credit in a computer programming course.

 Can you leave the course up on line  for a few weeks after the last lesson  so I can catch up?Thanks 
55e1d6379714b05c5d000a2d
OK, I fixed it myself :-)\nThe permission requests in the AndroidManifest file were entered by copying the lines from the textual instructions, but these two lines lack the proper closing syntax in each line (the </uses-permission>). I found it out when I viewed again the video. \nAs I'm not a programmer I didn't catch it when I copied the lines.\nIt doesn't explain why the browser in the emulator doesn't work, but I no longer care about that.

Can I know which version of JDK are you using? In the mean time, you can uninstall your current JDK and install JDK 7 or higher version and do the the following:\n\n1. Launch the control panel\n\n2. Edit the system environment variables (e.g. In Windows 7 search for "environment variables" or go to "System and Security > System > Advanced system settings" and click on Environment Variables)\n\n3. Double-click on CLASSPATH and delete the path to the Old JDK version (e.g. JDK 6) of tools.jar in both "User variables" and "System variables"\n\n4. Finally plz update JAVA_HOME corresponds to new installation.\n\n

I have had all the same problems. Analyzed the test case to understand the issue and did a watch on server, the test fails before the GET for the images is ever issued. There is no time to load the images. As far as I am concerned it is a test case problem. Have spent hours trying to resolve. Will need to submit without automated test. Suggest to the professors that timeouts should be chosen carefully and that they should be variable if at all possible so students can adjust for their specific machines.
55d947f701772b2d7000032e
I had one that appeared as if they put in the code from the exercises and not the homework assignment.  I assumed they were probably not proficient enough in the English to understand the assignment instructions.  I did give them partial credit though as one of the exercises was close enough to the actual assignment that I considered it correct :)
55de6da201772b0c4d000812
I did also experience this error a couple of times but I cannot reliably reproduce it.
55de6da201772b0c4d000812
To better convey what I and others are experiencing, I have posted a YouTube video of my project at https://youtu.be/fC61CkEKZqk \n\nIt is 5 minutes long but the important parts are 0:30 to 1:05 which shows a successful run, and 3:30 to 5:00 which shows the failed test run.  The video does not show it clearly, but only 2 of the 4 images were downloaded from jnode before the test failed (around the 4:15 mark) and then a 3rd image shows in the jnode console.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that from my perspective the test already showed it failed before that 3rd image showed in the jnode log (although I guess it could just be a delay in jnode logging it to the console).\n\nAt this point I'll probably just submit my assignment without the screenshot, but hopefully this video will help the professors identify a problem if there truly is one.\n\nThanks,\nRichard

Thanks for en excellent course on Introduction of Mobile Application Development on Android, the professor, as well as the material were well prepared, so that it was easy to understand it, even if you are not into programming with Java.\n\nA suggestion that I may add is related with the homeworks. They should be more challenging cause in this course, the solution was almost provided with previous exercises and i think that does not foment the interest in the research of new topics related with the exercise.\n\nSummarizing, I really like this course and I hope it could be repeated so more people know about it, thanks for all Mr. Muppala

Make sure IIS is setting the content-type correctly ("application/json"). I've heard it has trouble with that.
55e0e98501772bea80000925
I think my problem was a bit earlier:\nStep 3: Setting up JSON-Server\nAt the command prompt type the following to install a simple JSON server package in NodeJS.\n    npm install -g json-server\n\nPlease see attached image.\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14408044918093385.png
55e0e98501772bea80000925
Could you give us more details about the computing environment you are using? Is it Windows or Mac? After you install json-server with "npm install -g json-server", you need to make sure that it's correctly installed. Quit the command window and start it again to see if\nit solves the problem. Node installs all these in a global directory (depends on your OS) when you use the -g option.

For example I downloaded and unzip the files on:\nC:\HKSTU\Server\n\nMy current directory in cmd is C:\HKSTU\Server\Server\n\nBut I don't see any file called json-server

Try remove unlock screen on emulator. I had similar problem. You can do that pressing F2 when open emulator, then settings, and section "Security" and  screen security set  to "Screen lock none".\nIf you have another problem, check your code.![enter image description here][1] \n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14407997803268422.png

I really enjoy taking this course, it is very usuful to people like me that did not know anything of android programming.. now I have a startpoint and can continue learning. Many thanks to Professor Muppala and staff. Mr Muppala, you made everything very easy to understant and follow. I would make exercises more challenging and do something from the scratch, that's the only thing I would change of this coure.\n\nThank you very much for this experience!

when I unzipped the file it created a server director, I then cd'd to it from a command prompt and executed "json-server --watch db.json\nit came back with:\n\{^-^}/ hi!\n\nLoading db.json\nDone\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n\nType s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database\nWatching...\n\nThen when I entered http://localhost:3000 in chrome I got {} as the result\nand in my cammand window it showed:\n\nGET /people 404 13.374 ms - 2\n\nSo is that what was asked? Did I follow the instructions correctly?\n\n

You guys did a bang up job teaching a complex subject matter. It was a little interesting adjusting to getting things done by Hong Kong time, but hey no worries. The lectures were well put together and interesting, and I really enjoyed the course. \n\nThe only thing i felt was lacking a little was the amount of code we were required to write in the course. This may have been intentional, but increasing the coding requirements would be a good thing. \n\nas another aside: Microsoft puts out an android emulator called Visual Studio Android emulator. It is *_much_* better than the emulator that android studio provides. It does require a bit of tnkering to get it to play with android studio, but Microsoft has a great post on how to fix the issues. IT is super fast and has a bunch of images. I was shocked, and I used it on the last couple exercises. \n\nHere is the link to it. You do need to be running windows to use it, not sure it is available on linux or mac. \n\nhttps://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/features/msft-android-emulator-vs.aspx\n\nAll in all, I had a blast in the course and I learned quite a bit. I look forward to more advanced courses from you Mr. Muppala and staff!

You can use "Nexus S", it is faster than other AVDs.

Hello altoyudano,\n\nI experienced this same issue and after comparing the ChatClientNetwork and ChatClientNetworkFinal projects I came up with a solution.\n\nChange the following line from build.gradle\n\nfrom\n\n>     androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:22.1.1'\n\nto\n\n>     androidTestCompile 'com.android.support:support-annotations:22.2.0'

I had one that was the same as you described. The screenshot was unreadable and I could see the //TODO was there but no code. However, the rubric only mentions the green bar, so I felt I had no choice but to award a point because according to the rubric, it was a passed test. It was also clear from the pasted code that the server url would not pass the test. I recommend the staff changes the description to a minimum resolution for the screen shot so you can at least see the code which should match the pasted text.

Hello:\nI think overall knowledge contributed well, but on evaluations did not like the way they work, do not take into account the questionnaires and are based solely on exercises, think they are not evaluating well the course, is a pity.

Dear Dr. Muppala and Team,\n\nThank you very much for offering this excellent course. I have taken online android programming courses before and familiar with some of the concepts.  What stands out in this course is, example programs which are well written that can be easily understood even by a novice Java programmer like me and step by step explanation of those programs. I feel that this course can be made even better by making the assignments more challenging by including more TODOs. \n\nThanks again for offering this course. Looking forward to more advanced android programming courses.\n\n\n
55e06de201772b2d7000092c
I should not be specific. Please look at some other resource directory where you will get the images and use that directory in your code as like as R.drawable.user_placeholder.
55de6da201772b0c4d000812
I use a device specifically an kindle and it run fine (I still don't pass the test) from a performance point of view, The emulator on my machine was way to slow, maybe you could try a device?\nCheers,\nTony

The server folder that is the result of the extraction of the zip file is actually not the server folder you need to start the server from otherwise the wrong db is used.\n\nI copied the server folder from inside the original extraction result folder and overwrote the contents of the higher level server folder with it. That then lets you run it the way you were trying to.\n\neg cut /server/server and paste it over the contents of /server

Can you please first try by the way tutorial suggests. Bcoz, you need to change the declarations in some of the places. I think that it has not been done accordingly.
55e0555801772b996a00096c
Usually Emulator works slowly without HAXM. Plz assign less memory to your AVD while creating and unlock the AVD before performing the Test. Hope it will help you.\n
55e048b301772b0c4d00098d
Plz open a terminal (command prompt) and go to the directory where you have copied the server folder, start the server, and follow the necessary steps as discussed in the tutorial.
55d2064ab30d846a86003401
Thank you.  I signed up late and will take the class "self-paced" over the next 3 weeks.  As you noted.  I will "reference to some of the basic knowledge regarding Android application development and the Android Studio IDE."\nThank you, Mike Schwab
55e0445d9714b0505d000967
It's a memory issue. It will help you if you assign less memory to your AVD.

You can look at Android developers' website. I think it will you a lot.\n\ndeveloper.android.com

very well done , this course was really clear and focused on certain aspect instead of messing up all the information togheter . Thanks!!!!!

Same with me.\nMy app is running OK but slow(AMD cpu) and the test results in error\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Could not launch intent Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN flg=0x14000000 cmp=hk.ust.cse.comp107x.chatclientnetworkfinal/.Contacts } within 45 seconds. Perhaps the main thread has not gone idle within a reasonable amount of time? There could be an animation or something constantly repainting the screen. Or the activity is doing network calls on creation? See the threaddump logs. For your reference the last time the event queue was idle before your activity launch request was 1440756873330 and now the last time the queue went idle was: 1440756884175. If these numbers are the same your activity might be hogging the event queue.
55de1bd59714b07b990007d7
Yes, you can add several paths by separating them with semicolon (";"). So path variable may look like this: \n"C:\Program Files\nodejs;C:\Users\Papa\AppData\Roaming\npm".\nMaybe you should add it not to USER variable PATH, but to SYSTEM variable PATH.\n\nAnyway, after installing a server (i.e. typing "npm install -g json-server"), directory C:\Users\Papa\AppData\Roaming\npm\ should contain "json-server.cmd" file.\nIf so, try to execute \n"C:\Users\Papa\AppData\Roaming\npm\json-server --watch db.json"\nhaving "server folder that you created by unzipping the configuration files" as current directory in command line.\n\nAdding some paths to the PATH variable needed only to skip paths to executable file. So you can type just "json-server" instead of "C:\Users\Papa\AppData\Roaming\npm\json-server".
55e02a519714b0b433000932
I assume that you are talking about the following statements:\n\nwhile ((readLine = in.readLine()) != null) {\n\n                    buf.append(readLine);\n                }\n\nThis is the way the readLine() method works. You can look at other read methods in Java, then it be clear.\n

Hi \n\nI have enrolled in this course on August 23 2015. I like this course a lot when I view the contents. That's why I chose to enrol. In the grading scheme, I found out that I must get a passing grade of 60% in overall weighting. What I want to know is that how can I get the passing grade since this week is week 5 which I started this course. Is there any other way round to pass this course for me? Or is there any other course that start in this week? Thanks.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
The course is very good. Now, I have a handful of tested android apps which could serve as basis of future projects. Looking forward to a follow-up course soon with : \n\n - one more week to allow assignment submission.  \n - teaching on using the debugger.\n\nThank you very much.
55dfabc59714b042a6000896
I had one of those that I was extremely suspicious of.\nIt does seem that some people on here don't do any of the work and just want a pass grade to put on their CV
55dfe99a01772b2feb000912
I think it is a memory issue. Please use the small size AVD like "Nexus S" and I hope it will work fine.
55dfdc2701772bc9ad0008ec
Hi altoyudano,\n\nDid you use the project zip file we provided? Please make sure you don't change the gradle.build file. Otherwise, this kind of problems could occur.
55df91bc01772b5ea60008c3
Thank you very much! Everything is OK now :)
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thank you very much Mr Muppala. I have found this course very interesting and I had fun going through it. Now I understand this modern technology of mobile devices better. I am going to continue learning at the android developers site, just from "Getting started" http://developer.android.com/training/index.html, and to create my own small personal application. Best wishes and many thanks to you and others who have helped to make this course. I also would like to wish every success to all fellow students.

Every Java type (including primitive types and arrays) is associated with a Class object, which can be obtained with .class. If you have an actual instance of a class, use .getClass() on the instance to obtain the same result.\n\nIn the above example, FriendInfo[].class returns a reference to the Class object associated with "array of FriendInfo".\n\nhttp://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/classes.html\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/15078935/what-does-class-mean-in-java

And , if I am allowed to comment, always have only one Emulator running .That is your should have only live android screen running on the system.
55de1bd59714b07b990007d7
so we can add 2 path variables?\nSince I have already added C:\Program Files\nodejs
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Few Suggestions\n1) Should also include Assignment solution videos once the due date is over.\n2) All the videos should be available for download in the Resources link so its easy to view them offline. (currently its available in individual topics)\n3) Most of the students were unable to configure Virtual Machine and it still remains the no 1 issues to be fix. if the team can look into this.
55dce3d99714b04b610005e7
Thank you! That wasn't clear to me. You got to the heart of the problem. too bad the Community TA didn't figure this out.
55df37e09714b04b61000888
Having a separate activity for each table sounds like overkill. How many do you expect to have? 
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
You should definitely do something like a more in-depth follow up course, if it could be verified also that would be great. This course was very good for it's duration, its a shame its not longer and more into some aspects as the dynamics of the zip files I feel left some holes in my basic knowledge. Thank you very much for your time and effort, when i create the next big app I'll give this course and Professor Muppala a shoutout!
55df37e09714b04b61000888
Most of the entries are tables of values, some have images. I plan to create a separate activity for each table. Its more of a data book than a glossary, I guess. So, the app size won't affect performance?\nThanks a lot!!:)

Hi BubaManjang,\n\nI am sorry to tell you that you cannot submit assignments that were due.

Hi there,\n\nDid you unlock the screen lock before you compile and run?
55df8fdd01772bf71400091e
Hi ACalvano,\n\nPlease make sure you go to the server root directory before you start the server.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Hi!\n\nI want to thank heartedly the HKUST team and specially our teacher J. Muppala for putting together this course which was very useful and entertaining. I really enjoyed it and I hope there are more courses like this to come.\n\nCongrats for the great work!\n\nCheers,\nFavio.
55df8fdd01772bf71400091e
You are starting server from wrong directory.
55df37e09714b04b61000888
Consider the size of apps - they are rarely less that 1 MB and typically more than 10 MB. If your glossary has 1000 entries and each is 1000 characters long, that's only 2MB of data. You could have 10 times that much data and still not have a particularly big app. If you include images you might need 100 kB per entry, which would be on the order of 100 MB for the app, which is getting large but still manageable. You might want to explicitly warn your users if your app requires more than 1 GB. If you need even more space you should consider storing your data on a web server. \n\nRegarding speed, if your data are stored in a local file that you can read completely into memory, the access time will be insignificant compared to the user's input latency. If you access a local file for each update, there may be a slight delay, and if your data are stored on a remote server then expect the usual internet delays.\n\nGood Luck!
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I took this course mainly to get familiar with Android Studio after using Eclipse ADT for a couple of years. I can imagine that it requires many difficult trade-off decisions to design an introductory course on Android development - it is a vast subject that can overwhelm a novice. Professor Muppala has done an admirable job - the course was interesting and informative. Thanks! 
55dfbd689714b058d9000917
In this exercise, we don't need the information beyond the Contacts class. So I declared it here. In case you are using the friendInfo class information elsewhere, I would suggest declaring it as a separate class with its own methods (not an activity. Activity is used only if you have a UI screen to be supported)
55df1f0b01772bc9ad00083f
And also do not close the command window(cmd in windows) otherwise server will be closed too.
55de6da201772b0c4d000812
Have you looked at the shell from which nodejs is running? It should show you the GET requests it is serving. Do the GETs for the 4 images appear there?
55de6da201772b0c4d000812
If you do everything accordingly, it will not take long for the testing code. After reading the comments I have tested several times and found that it takes short time as before in past assignments.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
What a stunning android course!! Many thanks for the instructor and the team behind . 
55de1bd59714b07b990007d7
I am not familiar with nodejs but I have done the exercise. Your output look similar to mine.\nTry to add path "C:\Users\Papa\AppData\Roaming\npm" to the PATH variable too and then start server.
55de1bd59714b07b990007d7
Now I have the next paths in the PATH variable: \n"C:\Program Files\nodejs\;C:\Users\Aleksey\AppData\Roaming\npm;"\n\nnomanoma, try to restart command line (if you changed PATH variable and did not restart command line then changes in variable will not be applied to that command line).\n\nDid you run "npm install -g json-server" command? Do your output look similar to Suveni output?

55df3c9801772b83ae000904
Hi nomanoma,\n\nAdding system path variable can be a solution to this problem. You may first locate where json-server is installed and then add the directory containing it in the path variable.
55df354e9714b07b990008d1
Hi Udanwojo,\n\nPlease make sure your Techno H6 and your machine are in the same network. 192.168.*.* are IPv4 Private Address. You handheld device cannot "locate" where the server is. So please make sure they stay in the same network. And also make sure firewall settings allow port 3000 for incoming and outgoing connections.

Wherever you extracted the server.zip file to. When you extract it, you should get a server folder. That folder is the one that you should run the command from.
55def89a01772bc8520007db
The whole point of the exercise is to figure that out on our own. Try printing out the variables that you have to the console to see what they contain and work from there.
55defd149714b05c5d00081a
I ran into the same issue. All I had to do to get it working was to rebuild the project. \n\nFrom the main menu:\n\n> **Build** > ***Rebuild Project***
55df1f0b01772bc9ad00083f
Did you start the server from the directory that you extracted from the archive? Did you specify that it should watch the db file, like so:\n\n>     json-server --watch db.json\n\nPerhaps if you provided the command that you are using and the directory that you are running it from as well as the location were you extracted the files, we might be able to further assist you.

Hi AnandPadmanabhan,\n\nYou may go to the directory where you unzip the service configuration files and then run the command to start the server.

Exactly the same with my application and tests :-(
55decf839714b06f3d00082d
The JSON strings are in the db.json file. Json-Server works by reading and writing from this file.

Would like to thank Mr. Jogesh and team for the efforts developing this excellent starter course for Android programming. Had an excellent time doing the course. Given the duration, it's a wonderful course with good practical use cases.\n\nI have just one feedback - exercises can be made more challenging.
55ddad3001772bc8520006a0
path means how to set path sir 
55de917d01772bf07a000870
Thank you very much for an honest comparison of the courses. I learnt a lot from all the feedback from the students about how to improve the course. Your encouraging words to design a more challenging course is noted, and hopefully we'll create a two course sequence in Android in the future to address those aspects that I could not get to in this course. Also we'll up the ante on the assignments in the future.

Hi ubrmax,\n\nWhen you write .class after a class name, you're referring to the corresponding **class** instance.\n\nWe normally write that in one line. But in case you get a long line, you may split it into two so that it's easier to read. But for best practices, we write it in one line.

Thank you very much for taking much effort to setup this course. It was a fantastic opportunity for keen learners to learn from A to Z without struggling in the dark. I have been wanting to learn Android technology for long and did not know how to start and could not afford going to classes neither. This course gave all I need to begin with and will carry further on even after the course. I appreciate very much Mr Muppala and staff putting so much labor into this and you should be proud of what you have done. In case you want to revise the course I suggest to lengthen the duration to 10 weeks so that you can explain the source codes in greater details and the students are given more challenges in their exercises.
55dce3d99714b04b610005e7
Hi Jlvidals.\n\nGoto class constants, change the value of 'SERVER' to IP address of your computer.
55de4eca9714b0e00a0007c6
Thanks for pointing it out.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thank you, Mr. Muppala and staff, and EDX ,of course! I enjoyed this course and I will use it as a reference for other applications. The network code part was one of the most interesting ones, for me. \n\nI think code tests are OK but they also limit how things have to be done. Maybe we could also write a very small application from scratch - all parts, layouts files, code parts,  related to the content that we are dealing in these tests, that would become a complete application at the end of the course. \n\nAgain, thanks a lot for this course.\n
55dc44329714b0044d00052c
Please note that the emulator is running inside its own virtual machine. So if you use http://localhost:3000/, this will refer to the virtual machine within which the emulator is running. The server is running on your PC, not within the virtual machine. So you have to explicitly give the IP address of your computer, e.g., http://192.168.1.111:3000.
55de4eca9714b0e00a0007c6
You are starting the json server from the wrong directory.

55ddad3001772bc8520006a0
You either did not install them correctly or they are not in your PATH.
55ddd7cd9714b0ee81000712
Try printing out the variables that you are using to the console. It helped me to determine how to construct my URL string.
55ddd2999714b0ff9c00073f
Was that you? ;) \n\nI went ahead and gave them credit since the instructions did say that it did not have to be 100% correct and just from looking at it, it should have worked.
55ddd7cd9714b0ee81000712
I was getting that when I had a problem with the url string/network retrieval.\nCheck the log to see and it will probably show a network error.\nThen start looking about the url string you pass in.
55ddd2999714b0ff9c00073f
AFAIK using constants is the better approach but there is nothing actually wrong about using the ip address in the code as long as the final url string is correct and uses the variable picture based on the list element
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I must say that I really enjoyed the course. With me being relatively new to Java, it was a rocky start. I wouldn't consider the topics that were covered as entry level though. \n\nFor me the difficulty was in determining whether the code that I was typing in was native Java/Android or code that was written by Dr. Muppala. I think it would have helped tremendously if he had made a video of him creating the chat app from scratch. Perhaps once the submission date has passed for the final assignment, one can be uploaded?\n\nAs it stands, I don't think that I could create an app from scratch, but if I needed to implement any of the topics that were covered, I wouldn't have a problem. Just the getting to that point... would.\n\nThe instructor was awesome. He explained everything in a clear and detailed manner that made learning the material a breeze. At any rate, what I have learned here will definitely help me on my path to becoming an Android Developer. Thank you very much for taking the time to create this class and more so for offering it free of charge!

Yep, same problem with 127.0.0.1:3000 as with localhost:3000.

That is a class A network address which is often corporate. \nI wonder if you have some routing/firewall/proxy issues that is preventing the emulator from connecting in this way.\n\nJust to confirm putting http://10.0.36.114:3000/people into your PC browser returns values but putting the same into the browser in the emulator returns an error?\n\ndid you try 127.0.0.1:3000?\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thank you for putting this course together, having done a few short demonstration videos myself I am aware just how much effort must have gone into it.\n\nIt was a good introductory course and I definitely enjoyed it, though I did not find it very taxing.\n\nA few comments that I would hope you take into future courses...\n\n1. People have lives, especially in the summer months. The pace of the course was good but please always allow a minimum of TEN days for submission deadlines from the time of making the assignments available. This does not need to alter the weekly schedule for new content but will allow people to catch up if they are away for a week.\n\n2. Most of the assignments could be performed using cut and paste. These should be made in such a way that people actually have to think and problem solve.\n\n3. (for EDX): put a 'mark all as read' button on the discussion forum.\n\n4. Please try and make the projects more additive. i.e. don't require a new project file for every part. This is quite annoying when people are trying to extend the projects over and above the course. Of course there should always be a optional project file for each part for people who have not been able to properly solve the previous exercise or whose mods break something.\n\n5. A proper explanation on debugging (tools and techniques) problems early on might help people solve problems for themselves. I have not yet found decent debugging tools in the studio as the crash information is often very poor. I have though usually managed to solve issues by using basic problem solving techniques.\n\n6. Start off with a well structured discussion forum that includes as a minimum sections for hardware/tools issues. Common problems solved/FAQ\n\n7. Be strict on people posting in general section or repeating questions with existing answers (but make this clear up front).\n\n8. (probably for EDX): allow feedback conversation on peer marking and have the ability to change/override scores if necessary.\n
55dc44329714b0044d00052c
I should add that I'm using Ubuntu Linux 14.04.
55dc44329714b0044d00052c
I've got the same issue, but for me it works with a browser on my PC, but not with a virtual device.\n\nIf I try using the browser on the virtual device, I get 'The webpage at http://10.0.36.114:3000/people could not be loaded because: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED'. Similarly for localhost or 127.0.0.1.\n\nSo something seems wrong with my emulator's network.\n\nI have an old Gingerbread device, so I was able to modify the minSdkVersion in the build.gradle file and the ChatClientNetwork runs correctly there.

I enjoyed the course very much. It is a nice way to start learning about programming Android\n\nBut I have also some remarks.\n\nI came here after the 102.1x and 102.2x Introducing to Java Programming courses \n\nI had no idea about Java and I learned a lot, even I made small programs for me. But I am not an expert, so after this course, I don´t know if some questions are from Java or from Android, and I still don't understand many code lines and what are they for. I don't know if I am able to start a program from zero.\n\nI am waiting for a second Android programming course, but meanwhile, I have to improve my skills, re-view the videos, read more resources and see more examples, perhaps, more basic examples.\n\nPerhaps, this course should be taken in 10 weeks with the same contents.\n\nAnyway, Mr. Muppala thank you very much for the course \n\nAnd also thank you all the staff, and thank you peers for your comments in the revisions and your help in the discussion forums\n\nI hope we will see in the next HKUST Android programming course\n\nBest regards and wishes,\n\nDiego

This has been a fun 5-week course. During the learning period yes, there had been frustrating times, but through each week, i've learned to develop logic thinking to complete each assignment.\nThe course materials and exercise helped quite much to understand the basic of android n java programming. I am currently taking a undergraduate online college program in Marketing Management at Binus International University, Jakarta (www.binus.ac.id). By participating this edX course, I learned more how to manage distant learning with online learning method.\nThanks Jogesh and edX team.\n\nAlto

I enjoyed the course and learned a lot. The lectures were well done, and the assignments were interesting. \n\nThe assignments were very easy -- most took only about 10 minutes -- and it would have been better for me if they were a little harder. But I also found that I could modify the apps and learn a lot from doing that, so it wasn't too bad. I have to say, though, that I am very far from being able to program an app on my own from scratch. \n\nThank you very much for the course, and I hope you offer it again soon for other students. I also took the two Java courses from Hong Kong University as well, so this course was an excellent follow-up to those. \n\nThanks again!

Hi htahani,\n\nThis is the Gson repository[ \[https://github.com/google/gson\]][1]. You may go there and get the .jar file. Btw, I don't think you need it. You just need to follow the instructions as given [here][2]. This should already work perfectly.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/google/gson\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/93ca675ee54240d79cddc6219556011f/9eb1c23f842b4bc49a333c038a8e27cf/

Dear Team,\n\nI joined this course having some background in programming but not on the topic. During the first week, as I was setting things up on my old linux laptop (a Thinkpad T61), I was getting somehow frustrated by the speed of my computer which affected Android Studio and obviously the emulator on which my Apps would run on. However, after working some extra hours on my configuration, I learnt the way to run things not at a great speed but at least smooth enough for me to practice. Since then, I have enormously enjoyed the material, the lectures, the exercises, the projects and the discussions. The course has been very good as an introduction to this topic. The explanations from Prof. Muppala were easy to follow, and the video and slides were about the right amount. Thanks also for those contributing in the forums, a place where I found some comfort and tips on solving common issues. I look forward for the next level and the continuation of this course on EDX, which I totally recommend.\n\nWishing you all the best and many thanks.\n\nWarms regards from Colombia,\n\nAndres\n

Hi jlvidals,\n\nDid you follow the required steps? And please also make sure you can access the server path by trying it in the browser first. Your path could be http://127.0.0.1:3000/people or http://localhost:3000/people\n\nAlso make sure you've started your server by calling \n\n***json-server --watch db.json***
55dcd87a01772b660d0005be
Hi albatross666,\n\nIt's better to use Node.js because the features it provides are different from what IIS gives you. Btw, you may double check the json file to see if it's exactly the same as we've provided. And also check that you can access the db.json file in correct path.

Dear Dr.Muppala,\n\n     Thank you so much for offering this course, and I have enjoyed it very much. I had a bit of experience coding in Android before taking this course, but I had very limited understanding to many of the concepts in android, and often found myself confused when writing Android programs. This course is very well designed and its structure is perfect for learning Android programming. By talking us through the code line by line, you have explained the concepts to us very well. I found the material very comprehensible and easy to understand. If you are to offer more advanced courses or courses on other topics, I would definitely enroll. \n\n      The world of Android is deep and broad, thanks for guiding us through the beginning stage!\n\nKevin

Hi,\nI had the same issue as janotron. For me, GMan2XS had the correct solution. I had unzipped my server.zip into a folder called 'server', but I actually had to run the command from a subdirectory, 'server\server' for it to work. I originally ran the command from server, which gave the 404 message. Thanks GMan2XS!\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
Thank you Mr.Muppala and team and thank you edx. This was a wonderful course, very well explained. I was a total beginner in this field and this course motivates me to pursue  further in this direction.\n\nIt would have been great if this course offered verified certification. \n\nI look forward for  for more courses like this.\n\n\n

stupid mistake  - I constructed request like http://localhost:3000/people/John.png\nOf course, 'people' part is incorrect ) 
55dc44329714b0044d00052c
Sorry borochris, but I don't think it's that as the OP mentions that the server is showing the 404 message, so obviously the server is receiving the message from the app.

There must be a Button class and that is why the Prof. said we'll have to 'import' it. The Button class is in the default java library therefore if you must use it, you will have to import it.

I was in the software industry and had to resign 3 years back due to \npersonal commitments. When I wanted to refresh my knowledge and get in touch again, I came across this course. I had worked on C, C++ and Java earlier but wanted to learn Android for a very long time. I was happy and very excited as this was my first online \ncourse and also the time flexibility it gave me to view the videos and learn at my own time. \n\nHowever, at the same time, it had assignments to complete with deadlines so it made me finish learning that particular weeks stuff on time. \n\nOverall, It is a great introductory course in Android and if it was for more than 5 weeks time, I am sure each and every aspect would have been covered and dealt with in more depth. The instruction videos were superb. My favourite was the quiz on some sections. When I came across some issues, I used the discussion section to figure things out.\n\nThank you for the nice work Mr. Jogesh Muppala and team. Thank you Edx and Hongkong University as well for providing a nice learning platform.\n\nI would like to work on more projects from scratch so as to learn and gain more confidence in this area and after that I am sure I will add this as another skill on my resume. Please guide me on where to find more projects/exercises to work on.\n\nI am looking forward to Part - 2 of this course.\n\nSelvi Bala\n
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
It's been a very pleasant 5 weeks. I can say I've learnt enough to get me start. Thanks to edx and thank to all the Staff (especially Mr. Jmuppala) for such a wonderful opportunity. \nI've already enrolled for other interesting courses. Thank you EDX!
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I really enjoyed this course. It gives a good foundation for further learning of the Android platform. The overall duration of 5 weeks seems optimal for me. If being asked for improvements I would suggest to make some of the exercises and assignments slightly more difficult - so that the code to be developed by us students is more than just a few lines.

I definitely liked the content which is practical instead of being theoretical.\n\nI, however, have complaint regarding the technical glitches which we, students had to go through - those screenshot issues - because of which I may not be getting the certificate :/ 
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
This is a very nice introductory course for learning Android. The weekly assignment is very helpful in getting to know how to do programming Android. However, it would be nice to have the some smaller lab project for student to experience with. After this course, I still can't get a handle on how to start an Android project from scratch because 99% of the work in assignment are done by our instructor. I hope there is a follow-up course that will going through all the topics in the course but with more depth and more experimental hands-on lab. Overall, this a very high quality introductory course for whoever wants to get to know a little bit more Android programming.\n\nThank you so very much for our instructor and the team working behind this course.
55dbef1601772bf4e40004c8
I really enjoyed the course, not only the course even the instructor and how he handled everything from beginning to the end.\n\nThanks eDX, thanks Jogesh Muppala.

55dc82f101772bf4e4000523
For example, in the following code:\n\n    public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements View.OnClickListener {\n    \n        Button greetButton;\n    \n        @Override\n        protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n            setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n            greetButton= (Button)findViewById(R.id.greetButton);\n            greetButton.setOnClickListener(this);\n\nI'm not sure of what most of the words mean. To begin with, mustn't there be a Button class of which an object (greetbutton) can be created. If so, then where is that class. What do @override, onCreate, setContentView, etc. do(Although the professor did mention some of these briefly, i wans't able to grasp their meanings)? \nThis is just one segment. In general, is there any way for me to understand the syntax?\nThanks!

Muppala you really made it really easy for us. your examples and assignments made the information stick to my cerebrum. Now, there's a lot of work to be done, this course only made my interest grow even bigger.\n\nCheers,

Hi,\n\nThis course is very interesting and helpful. I just suggest that duration of this course should be increased. As time is short (5 weeks) so some important aspects of this course was never explained.\n\nBut overall in 5 weeks, the content and explanation is so good.\nAfter taking this course, I am able to write android applications. And I got job.\n\nA big thanks to Mr. J. Muppala, his team, HKUST and off-course edX.

Hi,\n\nPlease let me know the links to start with and the libraries links as well.\n\n
55da9ee201772b8fd700041c
Priority\n\nYou can set the priority of a stream from low to high.\n\n**A stream’s priority is used to keep the number of streams within the maximum number of streams that can be played at the same time.**\n\n**The Stream Allocator will stop the lowest priority stream to allow a new stream to play without exceeding the maximum. If there are multiple streams with the same priority, then the oldest one will be stopped.**\n\nIf the new stream priority is lower than the active streams then it will not play.\n\nStreams can be stopped due to resource constraints.\n\nEach sound clip is given a stream ID when you call play() to start it playing. This ID is unique and refers to this instance of the stream.\n\nYou should release all resources used by the SoundPool object and set it to null when you’ve finished using it.\n\nhttp://www.101apps.co.za/articles/using-android-s-soundpool-class-a-tutorial.html

55da139b01772b5f500003b9
Thank you! While marking peer's assignments, they changed 1 to 2 and 3 respectively for both sounds. I gave them full marks anyways since I didn't quite understand (they also passed the automated tests), but I put 1 for all of them. Thank you for clearing this up!

55d632e801772b11430001d8
The priority is not used in this particular course for any purpose. However Android does support priority. Now suppose your game includes about 25 different sounds, and suppose you need to produce about 10 of those sounds at the same time (because of the situation in your app). SoundPool expects you to specify the maximum number of sounds that are simultaneously generated (maxStreams). Priority enables the sound pool play back to drop playing back those sounds that are of lower priority so as to produce only maxStreams number of sounds at the same time. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/SoundPool.html for more details.

Could I ask also why **priority "has not effect" as parameter** in method "load()" from SoundPool.class?  \n\n\n> public int **load** (Context context, int resId, int priority)\n> \n> Load the sound from the specified APK resource. Note that the\n> extension is dropped. For example, if you want to load a sound from\n> the raw resource file "explosion.mp3", you would specify\n> "R.raw.explosion" as the resource ID. Note that this means you cannot\n> have both an "explosion.wav" and an "explosion.mp3" in the res/raw\n> directory.\n> \n> **Parameters**\n> \n> context :	the application context\n> \n> resId :	the resource ID\n> \n> **priority** :	the priority of the sound. **Currently has no effect. Use a\n> value of 1 for future compatibility**.\n> \n> **Returns**\n> \n> a sound ID. This value can be used to play or unload the sound.\n\n\nCould I suppose that it is kept for further implementations of android versions ?\n\nthanks a lot

Could you be more specific? Alternatively, you could also search the threads of this forum for topics related to assignment 2, chances are, most of the questions have been raised and solved.

AnilParshi you need 60% to get a "pass" for the course, so I think you are above that threshold. But if I were you, I will definitely finish assignment 4 and assignment 5, they are the ones that teach a lot of new interesting knowledge (multimedia, network), and you won't regret if you spend your time finishing them.

55d9413101772b1143000368
Well ok, but what if we have the following case:\n\n1. game sound track on Media Player\n2. 4 ambient sounds: Tank, Helicopter, generator, waterfall\n3. a dozen or so in game sounds like: gun shot, bomb explosion, walking sounds, other player sounds, bird sounds, etc.\n\nSo I would need to have 5 simultaneous MediaPlayers to run at the same time?  or can we stack multiple sounds into one MediaPlayer?

**reyesruiz1998:**  If I understand you correctly, you are asking if we can just assign the objects time to the item being displayed.  Yes, I believe is the answer.\n\nSo something like this?\n\nTextView timeView = (TextView) messageView.findViewById(R.id.timeTextView);\ntimeView.setText(messages.get(position).getTime());

how much ram do you have? CPU? free hard drive space?\n\nif you are at 4GB ram, I would try using a less power hungry emulator.\n\nThe device is like a cell phone, I don't know if you need to be connected online or not but it took a really long time on my computer to initially set it self up.  It had to reboot several times just like a cell.  Have you tried closing it out and re-running it?\n\nalso have you read this post:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55bed4d2b30d841bfd00286a

AdejohIdoko: you could always delete the emulator and re-create it or try running a different "lighter" emulator like the Nexus S (ess) 480x 800 hdpi.\n\nThe virtual devices run in a Virtual Machine and act just like a cell phone.  If you can try rebooting the device and fixing it the way you would a cell.  No idea, but it might work.

I was thinking of trying this myself but haven't had the time. Probably when I am done with this course.\n\n**2 issues that you will run into:**\n\n 1. porting this to android or an android VM will not be automated and you will have to manually install it.\n 2. the test cases that are a 1 point requirement for all submissions most likely will not work as they are meant for android studio.  So if you try to use eclipse for the course you will most likely loose points when you submit the answers because of the lack of a "test complete" screen shot.\n\n**If you still want to run eclipse:**\n\nMost likely, you will have to download all of the classes for android sdk so that is will compile. Since I haven't done this I don't have instructions but the following posts might help:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/17481915/how-to-import-android-studio-project-in-eclipse\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16745793/how-do-you-open-an-android-studio-project-in-eclipse

**AdejohIdoko:**  Just finish the rest of the course.

I have been using **Integer.toString( the-integer-we-want )**  and it has been working well.\n\nSo for instance:\n\n>     public class stringTest\n>     {\n>         private int maxNumber = 1023;\n>     \n>         public stringTest()\n>         {\n>             String exampleString = "This is cool" + Integer.toString( maxNumber );\n>             System.out.println(exampleString);\n>             \n>             //test 2\n>             System.out.println(exampleString + " " + maxNumber);\n>             \n>             //test 3\n>             String thirdExample = "[" + maxNumber + "]";\n>             System.out.println(thirdExample);   \n>         }\n>     }\n\nOutput:\n\n>     This is cool1023\n>     This is cool1023 1023\n>     [1023]\n\nThe above will concatenate an integer to a string in 3 different ways.  If you have something like BlueJ you can copy-paste this above class into it to test.  So really you don't need to use either.  The "+" operator seems to be doing this fine as well. \n\nHowever, here is some wisdom from other developers why Integer.toString() and String.valueOf() can be of use:\n\ntoString: \nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/14126792/why-should-i-use-integer-tostring-instead-of-just-printing-the-integer\n\nvalueOf:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3335737/integer-tostringint-i-vs-string-valueofint-i

vramji93: I think this will answer your question:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/26708525/getting-position-in-oncreateviewholder\n\n>     @Override public int getItemViewType(int position) {\n>         // Just as an example, return 1 or 2 depending on position\n>         // Note that unlike in ListView adapters, types don't have to be contiguous\n>         if (messages.get(position).fromMe())\n>             return VIEW_HOLDER_TYPE_1;\n>         else\n>             return VIEW_HOLDER_TYPE_2; }\n\nSo from what I can gather because we are using "fromMe()" to determine if its 1 or 2 this will setup the **viewType** that is sent when **onCreateViewHolder** is called.  And it would be how the code works; Not that I find it particularly straight forward either.  I am glad you asked this question. I went out and found a few more links that might help explain the RecyclerView.  A more in depth conversation on this component might help other people from someone who knows more about why this component was needed and why they chose to design it this way.\n\nhttp://www.binpress.com/tutorial/android-l-recyclerview-and-cardview-tutorial/156\n\nhttp://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-recyclerview-and-cardview-on-android--cms-23465

In this case you could use a MediaPlayer to produce the ambient sound since it is long-lived and continuous. One or two media players at the same time are okay. If you wish,\nyou could stop one media player and then play the second one when you need the ambient sound.  SoundPool is more appropriate for short bursts of sound. This is because, the SoundPool class will uncompress the sound and keep it ready in memory. If you do this for long-playing sounds, then your memory consumption will shoot through the roof. Bad user experience.

Yes, the two are not interlinked. In this app we want the music to pause when the app is in the paused state and resume when it moves to the running state. However if we write a music player, we may want the music to continue playing independent of the activity. See my examples of Music player on my Youtube channel.

We are sorry to hear your bad experience of probably receiving invalid feedback with the potential of technical errors. Since your post was made anonymously, I cannot investigate your assignment submission. Secondly, we teaching staff have no power to modify any grades. With the current information, I would suggest you to write to edX support team (via their contact us page) to report the technical error and let them follow up with your certificate potential.

Now that I think about it, the menu variable is only being used in the onCreateOptionsMenu() method. So there's no need for the global variable. I think while trying various ways of organising the code, I used the global variable but later refactored the code.

55d7071201772b0cb0000265
That link is helpful, thanks.  For example, it says, "The SurfaceView is a special subclass of View that offers a dedicated drawing surface within the View hierarchy. The aim is to offer this drawing surface to an application's secondary thread, so that the application isn't required to wait until the system's View hierarchy is ready to draw. Instead, a secondary thread that has reference to a SurfaceView can draw to its own Canvas at its own pace."  \n\nHowever, the quiz question says, "SurfaceView requires the creation of a separate background thread."  "Requires"  doesn't seem to be accurate.  "Normal expectation", "aim", and "purpose" are not the same as "requires".
55d20537b30d846850003586
IMO self-paced courses are too easy to put off until later, which often stretches out to forever. Someone once said that a plan without a deadline is just a dream.

Read also http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/2d-graphics.html about SurfaceView. The normal expectation is that the canvas updates would be done on a secondary thread. All examples that I have seen so far suggest the use of a secondary thread. The complexity of SurfaceView is not needed if we are going to do everything on the main UI thread.

I had a group implement such an app in the past. Our app will automatically send SMS to selected numbers with the current GPS coordinates and also make a loud sound on the phone and cannot be turned off unless the phone was physically switched off. We used the telephony and SMS libraries of Android for this.

We need to be careful when we use the terminology. Most apps run in a single process. All the threads created by an app are all in the same process. If we offload some work to a background thread, then we will have two threads, the main UI thread and the background thread in the same process. You can use a tool available with Android SDK called as the Android Device Monitor (see under Tools->Android) to monitor individual processes running on the device (or emulator). There you can select your specific app (process) and see the threads using the threads tab

In SoundEffects.java we have the following constants defined:\n    public static final int SOUND_EXPLOSION=1;\n    public static final int SOUND_GUY=2;\n    public static final int SOUND_BULLET=3;\nI am guessing that at some point the test is expecting SOUND_GUY (which is a 2) but getting SOUND_BULLET (which is a 3).\nI apologise if this throws you off track. I am basing it on the numbers rather than any logic.

55d2064ab30d846a86003401
First of all I'm asking everyone a sorry that the comment is a bit long, as I'd posted this few days before and as I can't see any authorized reply I'm re-posting it as a comment..\n\n\nI've an argument today, I submitted my second assignment and I assessed peers which was given to me. After the assessment I saw my results which was assessed by some others, I'm attaching the image of which other peers done within my case. Yes of-course the code is not exactly right, but if I'm right according to the grading criteria, "The statement does not need to be 100% correct in terms of the Java language. It is acceptable as long as there is a ................ layout" so which means the coding is to be 100% correct/okay and one of my peers had assessed me according to that and as my automated test was not successful he just gave nothing for that and all others just gave me nothing for each and every criteria. As I'm new to java but still have a strong base in c as well as c++, I'm trying my level best to solve all those assignments and also my enrollment was quite late as even after the submission time of the first assignment. As my second assignment didn't gave anything to my aggregate percentage I will need to score 100% for the further assignments, which I don't know whether I can make to it, So that will result in loosing my certificate as well.. So please I request Everyone to assess all those peers after reading all those criteria and To staff I request If you can do anything in my case, please do help me. Thank you...\n\nAs when i submitted the feedback I do saw that the staff will see this issue when checking around the past records, so please I request you to look over this issue if you can.....\n\n\n\nEDIT 1 : I got 18% for my third assignment, but still I'm wondering how i can get into the aggregate of 60% as i didn't got any points for my second assignment as well as two assignments are only remaining(which makes an aggregate of 40% and even if i get that 40% i will only reach into a total of 58% only where for just 2% I'll loose my certificate as well), So I request you that if you can do anything with that assignment, please do it. Please any authorized ones please respond.. Please Please I request you..\n

Yes I definitely agree. Android is not as easy as I make it in this course. However my objective is to motivate those who are tentatively looking at this platform to take the first steps towards it. If you enjoy your first experience, you will then go out of your way to put more energy into learning it further. If you have a bad first experience, you will start avoiding the platform :-)\n\nThe course can be made more difficult. If there's so much interest, I can think of developing a full-fledged long course on Android based on what I teach on campus (14 weeks). However, at the moment I'm swamped with developing a large specialization on Full Stack Web Development that will launch in September, so this has to wait.\n\nI'll keep your suggestions in mind for future.

You can make the androidguy.move() return false when the guy hits the bottom. In DrawView, you can modify the if(androidguy.move()== false) { score.decrementScore(); } Do not set the androidguy== null. Remove that statement.

Thank you very much for your efforts. I think this is one of the best strategies for cementing the knowledge and assimilating it. I always encourage my students to do their own reconstruction of the material because this is the best way to understand what you understood.\n\nYes, putting together the material, making decisions on what to include and what not to include, and deciding exactly how much of detail to specify without overwhelming the learner is not that easy. In any case I expect students to go way beyond this course in order to become proficient at Android. Believe me, the platform is not that easy to master. I've been with it for over seven years and still keep discovering many things that I never knew before. So it's going to be a long journey learning Android. You're in it for the long haul. I was just trying to clear the initial roadblocks on the journey through this course.\n

55d38890d7c4e374280000ee
Hi Lawrence,\n\nIn Java, a dot (".") notation is used to separate the object reference and the method name. For more information, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/usingobject.html#methods\n\nIn SoundEffects.java, the code you refer to is all one long line. Whitespace has been added to improve readability. The actual line is:\n\n    AudioAttributes audioAttributes = new AudioAttributes.Builder().setUsage(AudioAttributes.USAGE_GAME).setContentType(AudioAttributes.CONTENT_TYPE_SONIFICATION).build();\n\nThe methods setUsage() and .setContentType() are designed to return the same object that was handed to them once they finish. This allows the methods to be chained.\n 
55d23434b30d843c410034b3
Yes, I modified it and checked it three times to make sure everything is correct. I am not sure if I need that behavior for the chat exercise as well which I will do next. If not I can just leave this problem and go on with the course.

The move method in Androidguy returns true whether the andoid guy is in the screen or hit the bottom. It does not return false.These are things I have tried\n\n1. In DrawView put the score.decrementScore(); inside the if (androidGuy.move() == false) {\n                androidGuy = null;\n\n            }\n2. Check for the position of Android guy using \nandroidguy.get(Y) >= androidguy.upperY\nand then decreasing the score \n\nnone of the ways worked for me \n\nIts either doing nothing or keeps decreasing the score as and when the android guys are falling down

Everyone should provide feedback for the peer assessments if there is something wrong.  \nOnce the feedback is sent about the peer who did on purpose, the staff should be able to figure it out who is that peer and the way he reviewed (did a mistake or did on purpose). Let's say for 3 real complains it could be removed from the course (after 2 previous notifications).\n\nOr maybe the staff has already a plan. If so, is better to be posted and anyone would know what to expect for in case of not playing fair.

In this example there is only one background thread manipulating the canvas, so synchronized is not really needed here. However, if you are implementing a general case where you could easily have multiple background threads simultaneously accessing the same canvas, then it's necessary to enforce synchronized access to the critical section (the canvas).

The stack trace in your post is giving some clues:\n\n- the app stopped at line 142 in `DrawView.java`\n\n- it also tells you that, at that line, android tried to invoke the method `draw()` on a Score variable, but that variable was still 'null'.\n\nSince `DrawJava` declares the instance property `Score score`, I would have a look at the constructor and make sure `score` has been set correctly.\n\n---\n\nAs you've noticed, the tests aren't really comprehensive. Passing all the tests doesn't guarantee the app will run correctly.

This is an introduction to Android course though, not an introduction to Java. It's not really aimed at complete programming beginners, more suited to people with programming experience who want to get into Android.\n\nA complete beginner could easily pass the course though, the assignments are very simple. I wold argue that if someone took it on themselves to study all of the app, and not just the TODO sections, they would be able to make simple apps after this course ends. But it would require a lot of self study.
55d072d0a9a36ed582003428
Why use String.valueOf(Object) anyway? For an explicit conversion wouldn't Integer.toString(int) be more natural?
55d2a652d7c4e358f1000047
I believe that this is one of the (minor) downsides of a MOOC. It is ***impractical*** for course staff to check each peer assessment to make sure that the assessment has been done correctly.\n\nThis is the reason why each student's work is graded by a number of peers and an average (of some sort) is taken for the final grade.\n\nI don't see how a warning can be given to students who grade improperly (without manually checking each assessment).
55d2cc6999918e9ac700006b
Hi TauseefMalik,\n\nIt seems like you didn't complete the assignment or your code is not correct. Also double check that you did not make unnecessary changes to the code other than those specified within the TODO labels.
55d2c2d7d7c4e34003000053
There are different ways to do this. One method is to make use of the return value of the AndroidGuy.move method. You can modify this method to return true if the AndroidGuy is still on the screen, or false if it has fallen off the bottom of the screen.\n\nThen, in the DrawView.drawGameBoard method, you can check for the return value and take the appropriate action.

Well, I found this course is so.. so easy. However, programming in Android is not as easy as profesor Muppala teaches us. I am enrolled in other courses about programming in Android; they require a lot of knowledge in Java. So, try to understand the exercises thinking as a novice, exploring the source codes and checking some previous knowledge in Java.\n\nProfessor, a good practice I could suggest for this course, and it has done by Professor TC Pong in COMP102.1x & COMP102.2x is to give us some exercise to talk in the discussion forum. Also, we could submit custom project based on exercises or assignments (in the discussion forum, too). Finally, you could talk about these custom exercises, making a video for the next week.\n\nPS: Sorry, I make a mistake in my first post.
55cffd1da9a36eb1420033a7
I agree. While I completed the assignment in 15 minutes I have spent hours analyzing all of the code for the game. I have found more satisfaction in manipulating the assignments that professor has given us than completing the assignments. There is a wealth of information that this course offers and I think he does a wonderful job of presenting it. You get out of it what you want to. I only wish it was more than 5 weeks.

I'm afraid that I'll have to agree with you guys. Most of the things being covered are going right over my head, but I can get past the assignments because of my familiarity with Java. As far as being able to create my own app after the course... well I think I am going to have to pick up some Android books...\n\nIt's not that the videos are not informative, it's just that we are not really being shown how to create the interfaces ourselves. Just how to get them to "talk" to each other. My son was taking the course along with me, but he is so lost that he didn't even bother doing this last assignment and is about to just drop the class. His exact words were, "I'm not learning anything..."

This sometimes could be due to network problem, I think you could wait for a while, clean and then build it again.

oneofmanystudents, I think it is fair to say that you have done quite a bit, I have seen all that personally and had pinned some of the good threads from you :). I think what I am referring to is that for the general students (myself included),  taking note will in fact help them because they need to understand every bit of information they write- some of which they are likely to overlook when they have the full textual instructions. It is not about whether you work hard or not, it is about whether you are given a chance to dig at it yourself.  I am speaking this from the personal experience, and when I first took the course, I was just as green as you with absolutely zero knowledge on Android, I hadn't even played with any Android device then. But taking note based on the videos had forced me to think clearly and deeply and doing the further research whenever I was frustrated, there were a lot of  materials that I would feel that I understand, but in fact I didn't. Only when I wrote them in the form of note and read it myself would I discover that from time to time I could be misunderstanding things and this enabled me rectifying them on the spot. I found this to be an extremely rewarding experience, and I am almost certain that I would have missed all these if I were given the complete set of note (in fact I do have it myself). that was what I was trying to say in the previous thread. Don't get me wrong, I am at your side :).  But I know a good learning process will force you doing the correct things and letting you the chance learn a lot, though it could come at a price of being slightly bitter at the beginning (because the time ratio could be huge, for myself a 10-minute video could easily take 2 to 3 hours to drop a clear set of note, but the time is not wasted! :) )

Hey!\n\nI think I was given the assignement of your reviewer and I discovered it. It works. I just find it complex whereas implicit conversion works fine.\nExplicit conversion using more common conversion methods and temporary variable work too.\n\nI'm just at a beginner level in Java devlopment and not aware of industry standards. I understand the potential risk of unexpected automatic conversion type, but in this case I just wonder if implicit conversion is just not enough.\nAfter what I was commented, it seems not....\n\nAny opinion?\n

You have submitted at a busy time, when many other people are trying to do the same thing, so you must be patient. For a fast response submit well before the deadline. Also, be aware of the time zone difference: 11:59 p.m. is Hong Kong time.

You can still pass if you submit assignment 3 now and then get perfect scores on assignments 4 and 5, giving you 60% total. Assignments 1 & 2 can no longer be submitted.\n\nGet going! You have just over 2 hours left for Assignment 3. If you have problems getting the emulator going, use a real device running API 18 or higher.

Jmuppala,\n\nI have never taken a programming course offering textual based instruction for programming exercises. It is too time consuming to develop.\n\nWhat you have developed is video based instruction with some text to put the video in context.\n\nYou should rename that section to video based instruction.\n\nI really enjoy the video based instruction. It shows me how to use the material from the lectures. Is the video perfect? No, but is much better than having only the lectures.\n\nMany of the students learn from the video based instruction but want the information clearly defined in more detail. However it is the job of the student to learn from the video and clearly understand it so they can begin programming.\n\n

Guys, why don't you try modifying the shooting game to support multiple falling Android guys and decrementing the score for each missed guy. Also, introduce multiple levels in the game. The explosion could also generate more fallout particles. Have some fun attempting these variations. Also could introduce two dimensional movements to all the items in the game.
55cffd1da9a36eb1420033a7
Thank you guys for encouraging me to be more aggressive with the assignments. In the next iteration I will ratchet up the requirements for the assignments. There's a lot more variations that I can create to the assignments to increase the difficulty level. I was conservative this time because this is my first experience with an online course.
55cfb901a9a36e3ee100339e
LamAlex, I understand what you're saying and that that may help some students, but I also know that all people learn differently.  For me, having Textual Instructions that were actual textual instructions that I could follow while watching the lectures would be very helpful.  It's difficult enough to follow the lectures as is.  Being given a Textual Instructions resource and then realizing that I'm just being referred back to the video is frustrating, if not a little insulting.\n\nIf you don't want to do text instructions, then don't.  I'll learn more slowly but at least it'd be less frustrating.  But if you're going to offer the resource then follow through.
55cfb901a9a36e3ee100339e
Of course, we students work! I watch all the lectures (more complex ones more than once), and take notes (I even transcribed a short video that you guys didn't have a transcription for, and posted it), and go off and experiment on my own (for example, before I knew we were going to be doing the colors, I got the chat client to use different colors for each person and correctly aligned, except that I didn't know you could use images and shapes so I had used the background color to style the LinearLayout of message.xml and mymessage.xml), and try to help with as many as I can of problems people are having. This is not about students not wanting to work, it's about communication and teaching.
55cffd1da9a36eb1420033a7
Jmuppala,\n\nThanks for creating the code which the course is using. The shooting game code was modular and easy to understand. Great job.\n\nSince the course is only 5 weeks long, it is challenging to provide coding assignments but they must be given so one can learn by doing.\n\nYou should not worry about satisfying everybody. You will not be able to do that. \n\nI believe you should try to determine how much time it should take to complete an assignment. Then that should dictate the difficulty of the assignments.\n\nAfter watching the videos and doing the exercises I completed the assignment within 15 minutes. If I did not watch the videos or do the exercises it would of taken a half hour probably.\n\nSo to me the assignment was too easy. The TODOs should be for a Android specific code sequence. A TODO to initalize a variable to zero is too easy.\n\nI realize there is a diverse student population but let's assume the student has taken a Java intro course and has no Android programming background and try to decide how much effort should be required for an assignment. Hopefully this will dictate the level of difficulty.

I do watch all the videos and take notes, but you need to remember that we don't have your level of knowledge or we wouldn't be taking the course. \n\n**A good teacher puts things in context and explains what we are doing and why**, not endless sentences which hide what is going on instead of making the main points. Something with meaning, along the lines of: in order to draw in Android Studio, you need to use a canvas. And in order to set up colors to draw on a canvas, you need to use an instance of the Paint class. -- \n\nI don't actually know if these are true or accurate, but they are the kind of information that can really help us, but they are few and far between and so buried among other things that it is hard for us to know which things are meaningful on the first time through the lecture, and hard to find on subsequent times through the lecture. \n\nAn idea -- What do you think of the idea of being a little more organized, for example having exactly two lectures for each program; the first lecture to have us go around and look at all the things so we know how they fit together, and the second lecture to make changes and actually do things in the files. You sortof do this a little but, but if these two parts could be *separated cleanly* like this and labeled as such, it would be a *lot* less confusing!

A really simple fix for this issue is to just add a i-- whenever we hit the clause that causes an item to be removed. That way we'll stay on the current position in the array and get to check the new object that just moved into that slot.\nI'm not a java programmer, but this should be a valid and simple solution, correct?

ubiquitus, when I took course for the first time myself, I found the learning process was much more effective if there were some work to be done at the student side. Back to then, I watched the videos, took the notes for the information mentioned in the videos, and then summarized them just as if I was taking it as a real class (instead of a video-based class). Because I had taken the note myself, I can still easily recall many of the important points after watching the videos. I believe if the textual instructions (note) has been included, it will in fact make it harder for you to learn because you will likely to miss a very important part of the learning process.

You will need to know initializing an integer to a value, basic arithmetic operations on an integer, creating a new object of a particular class, creating a new method in a class, and then call that new method at some point through an object instance.

You could refer to the note, basically you will need to use the drawText() method of the canvas object.

Anonymous said nothing about being unwilling to watch the video, just that it would be very helpful to have actual textual instructions to refer to when trying to understand what you are saying in the video.  I don't quite understand the point of having "Textual Instructions" that just say "Watch the video".  Yes, I watch the video and follow along on the subtitles, but the format of the subtitles are very difficult to follow without taking copious notes to jump back and forth on, which is difficult to do when you don't actually understand what is being said.  If you're going to have "Textual Instructions" then actually have textual instructions.  
55cffd1da9a36eb1420033a7
From what I understand these are 2 different complaints:\n\n1st one is about course material being too difficult. I can understand that for some it may be, although for me it seems ok. \n2nd one is about assignments beeing way too easy, and I totally agree. Even in the link you posted many people say that while the course is diffivult, assignments are too easy. Personally, I watch the videos, maybe struggle to understand a few things but I can do it ok, and then I go to the assignment. There, I except to have to use some of my newly acquired knowledge so I can truly understand it, but instead I just see very basic stuff and finish them really quickly without it helping me in any way.
55cffd1da9a36eb1420033a7

Good question! I had a go at attempting that yesterday, because I was severely annoyed by needing to tap the arrow buttons so many times to move it :)\n\nThis is how I did it in my app. I will provide some rough tips as to how I did it:\n\n1. First, you need to have variables (boolean flags, true/false) to keep track of whether a long left/right click is in progress\n\n2. Implement the onLongClickListener interface and override the onLongClick method\n - in the onLongClick method, set the flag to true to indicate that a long click (differentiate between left and right!) has been made\n\n3. Implement the onTouchListener interface and override the onTouch method\n - in the onTouch method, check that the event is an ACTION_UP event (i.e. the user has let go of a button) and set the appropriate flag to false\n\n4. In the Cannon.java's draw method, if the flag for long left click is true, move the cannon left before drawing (and do the same for right as well).\n\nIntuitively, what is happening is that, when user presses and holds the left button, the flag that says "long left click in progress" is set to true. When the Cannon's draw method is run, it will move the cannon in the corresponding direction before drawing it. When the user lets go of the left button, the onTouch method will be called, and the MotionEvent.ACTION_UP event will be generated. The "long left click in progress" flag should then be set to false, so the Cannon's draw method will only draw the cannon in its current location and not move it.\n\nNote that the above implementation is pretty much independent from the original movements. So, if you only click once, the cannon should still only move a single position.

There are a lot of little nuances to writing the code that just cannot be captured by writing down instructions. That's the reason I ask you to watch the video. There I am able to illustrate the point while doing the steps in a lot more detailed manner. If you are unwilling to watch the video, you can at least follow along the subtitles that we provide. It's best to learn the examples by watching the steps rather than reading them.

I agree with OP. Week 1 was standard and I got like 90% of it. Week 2, 50% and Week 3's grasp rate for me is below 5%!.   \nOne should note that difficulty of assignments is not a good way in measuring difficulty of the course.   For example,  I bet someone who doesn't know anything about android studio but knows java can do the assignment of week 3 in a blink of an eye. \n  \nThings like ArrayAdapter, Context, Iterator ... are a big question mark to me at the moment.  \nI think the professor's aim is to provide a basic familiarity (not understanding) with the concepts of android.   \nIn this approach, one can not say he can program and app right after this course actually.

Hey men, thanks, works great!
55ce1210a9a36e315a0031f1
Well, that's what I understood so far:\n\nWhen you use R.layout, it means that you're about to pass the xml file content (xml tags) to whatever is demanding it to be used. Mostly it is going to be inflated, which IMHO is a fancy name for instantiate an object by deserializing an xml content.\n\nWhen you use R.id, you want to access the element as an object. The element should already be inflated before. It's android's way of use an object that exists in whilst app is in execution.

I have the same problem. The chart didn't update.\n
55cd55edb30d84ede7002c03
I think this is how the framework is designed. You define a resource in xml. Android constructs an object representation of the resource, for example ***RelativeLayout*** defined in **activity_contacts.xml** and **activity_chat_client.xml** is represented by the Java class ***android.widget.RelativeLayout***. Finally, you code how that resource is used. \n\nThe only other alternative I can see is to code the resource entirely in Java instead of defining it in xml. But then you still need to code how your app uses the resource. Defining the resource in xml is easier than coding the definition of the resource in Java.

Layout is the total view and ID (id) is the individual element in the layout. You will find that we have created a layout named tool_bar and after that we are calling that tool_bar layout in an another layout named activity_chat_client likewise global method calling and we have assigned an ID to it and used it as an individual element. Thus, when it is individual element then it is R.id.* and when it is total view then it is R.layout.*. \n\nPlz correct me if I am wrong.

Here I got the two parameters of the Score class shown in constructor of Score.java.\nCan anyone confirm if there is only one parameter?\n    public Score(int color, Context mContext) {\n        paint = new Paint();\n        // Set the font face and size of drawing text\n        paint.setTypeface(Typeface.MONOSPACE);\n        paint.setTextSize(24);\n        paint.setColor(color);\n\n        // TODO initialize score\n        \n    }

We got similar feedback from some other students. We are sorry for that. I appreciate your job/motive, the people like you always do well. Plz don't judge yourself by grade, try to do the next 3 three assignments carefully and I wish you will be able to do that even if it crosses the margin, don't underestimate yourself. You have a lot of opportunities in your life. 
55cde2dfa9a36eb142003291
We have only one parameter in Score() constructor as follows:\n\npublic Score(int color){\n.....\n}
55ce0476a9a36e5a760032a1
Plz follow this one:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/18195807/android-studio-rendering-problems

You have to get 60% to pass the course, and you have three assignments in your hand out of 5. You can try to do that correctly and I hope you will pass...........
55cde2dfa9a36eb142003291
It seems that there are two parameters in Score() constructor as shown downbelow.\n public Score(int color, Context mContext)
55bf7b23b30d84c9b8002958
this is extremely useful... thanks!
55cdc6f5a9a36ee6f20031a9
This course is Pass/Fail course. It is fine if you get 60%.

In the exercise, we have found that the Cannon is shooting the AndroidGuy. When the cannon will hit/intersect AndoridGuy, then we will display the number of hittings/intersects. Here, score means number of hittings/explosions/intersects with each other.
55cde2dfa9a36eb142003291
Plz note that we have to create an object for Score class and above of it we have created an object for AndroidGuy class as follows:\n\n // create the falling Android Guy\n\n        androidGuy = new AndroidGuy(Color.RED, mContext);\n\nPlease follow the similar principles here, only pay attention to number of parameters in the Score() constructor where we have only one parameter but in the AndroidGuy() constructor we have two parameters. \n\n

Hi KwameHoggar,\n\nWelcome to this course! If you have time, please go through materials from Week 1. The assignment 3 is due on 17 Aug 2015 23:59 (GMT+8).

Hi vaddesirisha,\n\nYou may first complete the **draw** method inside the **Score** class. Refer to the **Cannon** class. Note some difference. You use **drawText** method instead.\n\nThen, you can fill up ***TODO show the score on the screen***. Refer to the first few lines of code inside the **drawGameBoard** method in the **DrawView** class.
55cdcae8a9a36ecf41003264
Hi Yogithaakula,\n\nPlease refer to the assignment reminder pinned in the discussion board. It tells you some notes you may want to know. You may go to the TODO labels and check. Some hints have been there to help you out. This assignment is straightforward. You don't need to write so much code. Just a little is enough.\n\nGoing through the exercise the instructor provided may help you too.
55cdbdd0a9a36e66e80031e7
Hi grdivya,\n\nThe **Score** constructor only takes one argument. You don't need mContext either.
55cd8953a9a36edd1600326c
Hi AjayVictor,\n\nPlease make sure you installed required packages in Android SDK manager, set up your Android Studio and imported the project correctly. Don't ever try to make unnecessary changes to the code, except the ones specified in the exercise tutorials.\n\nThis should fix your problem. The project is already ready to be opened by Android Studio. If you set up everything correctly, there should be no problems at all.
55c95af6b30d849ac8002d3d
problem solved by changing minSdkVersion value from 21 to 17

In the above example, you are extracting the string from the EditText widget on the UI and retrieving the string that the user types in. Once you get the string, then it's a standard Java string. Android supports the full Java language. You can use all the Java constructs. In the examples I used only simple Java so that it's accessible to most learners.
55cd7dafa9a36eb142003270
I mean these constructs from exercise 1:\n\n    EditText messageText;\n    messageText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.messageText);\n    String messString = messageText.getText().toString();\n\nSo I could do full blown Lambda-expressions, with streams and Java generics?\n

55ccde71b30d84770000314a
Hi YoavPridor,\n\nBecause the class **DrawView** extends **View**, the method **onSizeChanged(int, int, int, int)** will be called every time the size of the view has changed. The line below, as located inside the **onSizeChanged(int, int, int, int)** method, assigns a new value to the  instance variable **height** as defined earlier.\n\n        height = h;\n\nSo, it gets updated very frequently. That's where its value is assigned from.\n\nThe above applies to the instance variable **width** too.\n\nPlease have a look at [this link][1] for your reference.\n\n\n  [1]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#onSizeChanged%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int%29

Hi there,\n\nIn the ***draw*** method, we take a ***Canvas*** object as one argument. You can readily make use of this argument to serve the purpose.\n\n[Here][1] is a quick note for you. It tells you how to use the ***drawText*** method for ***Canvas*** object. There are several ***drawText*** methods available. But the one I give you in the link is what you'll need.\n\nThis should solve your problem in the assignment in Week 3.\n\nHave fun!\n\n\n  [1]: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Canvas.html#drawText%28java.lang.String,%20float,%20float,%20android.graphics.Paint%29

Try this: Download a FRESH version, and unzip it directly into the directory where Android Studio keeps your existing projects. Or, if you would rather unzip it elsewhere, copy the unzipped directory into Android Studio's directory manually. Then, open it as an existing project and ignore the message about Android using its own SDK.

55cc1bc8b30d848f100034a7
I had the same problem. Try updating to Android studio 1.3.1, which fixed the problem for me. 
55cb5d66a9a36e88ff003004
IMHO, teaching bad programming because it's easier to understand is not a good idea. After all, I think you can presume that people taking this course want to learn correct techniques. I.e. learn code that can be used to write own programs.\n\nThere are already much too much tutorials on the web disregarding the most simple rules!\n\nCode published here as an example might and will be reused.\nPossibly by more people than the number of those who are participating in this discussion.

Hi ghanlawal,\n\nPlease make sure you installed all required packages in Android SDK Manager. Also make sure you opened the project properly and did not make any unnecessary changes to the code. Strictly follow the steps as instructed in the exercise. This should be fine.

Do you check if you have installed the android sdk version of the project? The minimum SDK version is 18, and the app is maked to use in api 22. Check if you have installed API 22 and also check the version selected in the design view of the xml, in the android icon, above where should have the image of the phone

55cb5d66a9a36e88ff003004
I was waiting to see how long it will take for some one to identify and point out the issue with the for loop, and boy am I not disappointed! Thanks Boris for pointing this out.\n\nIndeed, a Java expert on campus pointed out the problem to me quite some time ago and we figured out that we should use the Iterator to handle it correctly. However, as Victor pointed out, the code with the iterator is not that easy for a novice Java programmer to understand, unless s/he knows the iterator well. So I decided to retain the for loop to make it easy to understand exactly what we are trying to achieve at that point. And that also gives an opportunity to discuss the issue openly :-)\n\nIf you are using it in production code, then it should definitely be replaced by the iterator approach as you rightly pointed out!\n\nFinally, a truly intellectual discussion about the course content! Thanks Boris for pointing us in that direction.\n\n
55cb9b29a9a36ee25a00307f
Did you just download it & try to run it or did you complete both parts of the exercise before running it?

Try looking at existing posts, specifically in the week 3 section
55cb5d66a9a36e88ff003004
Hi BorisGaertner,\n\nThank you for your discussion. As this course is just an introduction course, I believe not many students will understand how ListIterator works. And our instructor may not want to scare students off by using the advanced techniques. So that's possibly why he chose to use for-loop to iterate through the ArrayList.\n\nI believe we can still use for-loop to iterate through the ArrayList with a minor change. My suggestion is: \n\nWe use\n\n***for (int i = bullets.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)*** \n\ninstead of \n\n***for (int i = 0; i < bullets.size(); i++ )***\n\n

Hi jalpa192,\n\nPlease refer to the link [here][1]. Someone has encountered the same problem and has fixed it.\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55be38cda9a36e66e80026fa

In peer assessments, you will need to submit your own work and assess 5 other peers' work. You can only start assessing other peers after you have submitted your own work. **It is also worth to point out that the deadline for submission comes BEFORE the deadline for assessment. Please read the instruction on the assignment pages carefully.**\n\nThe steps for submission are listed in this post:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b87cc1b30d840995002403\n\nAfter you have submitted your own response, you will be able to look into other peers' response one by one. For each response, you can look at their submitted code for the TODO sections and the screenshot for their gradle testing results. Choose an option for each grading rubric, for example, if you believe the student's response matches the pass description, select "Passed", otherwise select "Failed" as illustrated in the following:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nYou are also encouraged to leave comments for your peers to tell them what you think about their code so that they can enrich their understanding. There are comment boxes for each of the grading rubric and an additional comment box for the overall response.\n\nAfter you finish assessing a peer, you submit your assessment and move to the next response by clicking the corresponding button:\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\nAfter you have finished assessing all the 5 peers, you will see a similar screen as follows:\n\n![enter image description here][3]\n\nYou can also choose to continue assess other peers to learning more and also helping other to learn. :)\n\nIf you wish to view the grade and comment from other peers on your assignment, just roll to the last section of the page.\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14393553241129952.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14393558224923362.png\n  [3]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1439355987683503.png

Hi Kasapa,\n\nI am sorry to hear about your case. But the submission period for assignment 1 and assignment 2 was over. Don't worry. You can still pass the course as long as you get 60% of the scores. So missing one to two assignments does not really matter.

I did get it to work. I have gotten the "unfortuntaely...stopped" message for other Android Studio programs and was never sure but I think I had run out of memory when that happened, and I just shut down everything and rebooted my computer (it may be that IF memory is the problem, that only Android Studio would have to be closed and reopened, IF that is the problem)\n\nI added these lines in ClientChat.java:\n\n    // TODO RECYCLER VIEW\n    \n    // get reference to RecyclerView\n    messageList = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.messageList);\n    \n    // make RecyclerView fixed size\n    messageList.setHasFixedSize(true);\n    \n    // layout mgr takes care of scrolling etc.\n    LinearLayoutManager llm = new LinearLayoutManager(this);\n    \n    // set to vertical layout\n    llm.setOrientation(LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL);\n    \n    // set llm to be layout mgr for RV\n    messageList.setLayoutManager(llm);\n    \n    // supply adapter for RV\n    messageList.setAdapter(mAdapter);\n    \n    //TODO TOOLBAR				\n    \n    // attach the layout to toolbar object\n    toolbar = (Toolbar) findViewById(R.id.tool_bar);\n    \n    // set toolbar as Activity\n    setSupportActionBar(toolbar);\n    \n    // get friend's name from Intent\n    Intent in = getIntent();									 \n    String friendName = in.getStringExtra(getString(R.string.friend));\n    \n    // Set the toolbar title to friend's name. This is a little quirk\n    // that once you get the toolbar to be an ActionBar, you have to\n    // use this approach to set the title\n    getSupportActionBar().setTitle(friendName);\n\n

It seems that the TIFF format is not supported. PNG or JPG should be fine though. Did you also check if you can see your screenshot on the first assignment?

We need to use API 21 or 22 to run the course programs, but we don't necessarily need to use hardware virtualization. \n\nYou can set up your virtual device to use ARM instead of x86 or x86_64, because ARM does not require virtualization / HAXM.

In my other edx courses, the progress tab information would be updated as soon as the assignment was completed (other than waiting peer reviews when necessary). \n\nI have never seen one that "waited" and I've completed 9 courses.\n\nI hope that Staff has a solution in mind if this *does* turn out to be a problem.
55c9cf55a9a36e2f6d002ef4
hi, please i am new. Just enrolled in the course and am two weeks behind. please how do i start? 
55ca1e1ea9a36ebe32002da6
With the first two assignments, the Progress updated instantly. That's why I wondered about the third assignment. \n\nI'm not worried about waiting. It just seems that something is broken. 
55ca1e1ea9a36ebe32002da6
Hi,\n\nYes, I think the chart is updated after each week. Let's see.
55c9cf55a9a36e2f6d002ef4
Hi chansiuhim,\n\nI believe the chart is updated after every week. I'll confirm again with the staff. Can you see your assignment scores updated when you scroll down in Progress page? If yes, then this is okay. 
55ca1e1ea9a36ebe32002da6
Maybe the system needs more time (or responses) before it updates Progress. \n\nOr maybe you broke it by being so fast ;)

Thanks. So true. I certainly will be making sure I press submit going forward! :)
55c9ebfeb30d84b96a002db1
The problem is the test. I have commented the libraries involved in testing and testChangeText() method and now I can run the app (and it works! ;) ), but I can't run the testing, of course

55c9ebfeb30d84b96a002db1
I run the app right after downloading it and I got that error, I tried importing org.junit.Before as you told me, but still it doesn't work. I think it has something to do with dependencies?? Some friends told me that my project is a gradle built project and the one I downloaded is a maven built project (or st like that). I have no idea of what it means
55c82f1aa9a36e86bc002dbb
Think about the opposite direction what if candidates fears to submitting just before the deadline which leads to Server Traffic 0 % ? it might be possible that pharming/DOS/DDOS(whatever malicious Activity) were not Happened ? What if there is a serious Bug at edx Developer side? anything is possible  but what Leave it. its OK i'm ready to compromising the situation Ultimately Knowledge is Important than some short of points :)\n\nThanks Jalegris for replying  :)

Hi minhtam8485,\n\nWelcome to this course. I understand you joined this course late but it doesn't really matter. As long as you get 60% of the scores, you can pass this course. Even though you missed two assignments, you can still have a chance to pass. No worries! We hope you will have fun learning how to write Android apps.\n\nCheers!
55ca062bb30d84ede700289c
Of course it's OK. Otherwise they would not have let you register at all. And if you can get a perfect score on the remaining assignments you can pass and get a certificate. But IMO, the certificate is a minor issue - it's more important to just learn about Android. Good luck!
55c9ffd0a9a36edf34002f0a
Hi VickyVicky1039,\n\nIt seems like you did not import the project in the same way as we do. Please download and unzip the project zip file somewhere in your disk. And then go to Android Studio and click "Open an existing Android Studio project", select the path to the project, and then wait until it finishes loading.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14393041555218605.png

Thanks
55c9f87fb30d849956002f4a
We don't use it in the assignment. However you can think of using it to decrement scores for those Android guys that you miss shooting down and they fall off the bottom of the screen. That would add another level of challenge to the game.
55c7ebd3b30d841bfd002e40
Hi BuGambit,\n\nYou had better learn more Java if you want to program in Android - it's only going to get more complicated.\n\nStart here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/
55c82f1aa9a36e86bc002dbb
I'm just guessing now, but submitting just before a deadline may be risky. Consider all the other people doing the same thing at the same time - all those server requests have to be queued up until they can be handled, which may delay your submission so that it appears to be late. \n\nThere's also the possibility that the server gets overloaded and simply starts dumping requests, or maybe even crashes. Malicious hackers depend on this sort of thing in their denial of service attacks, but it also happens inadvertently when traffic gets too busy.\n\nBottom line - don't wait until the last minute.
55c6848ba9a36e5e21002d64
See the pinned discussions. This problem appears to be solved.
55c9a708b30d8482e6002dd9
Need more info. What happens? What messages do you get?
55c9e58ea9a36e4e4e002e78
The maximum pathname length is typically 255 characters, which is being exceeded as you unzip. \n\nTry using a different unzipping program. I have heard that Winrar is good.\n\nOr, extract your file to a different location with a shorter pathname, such as the root directory.
55c9e780a9a36ebe32002d83
Yes, the sound part of the exercise will be in the next week.
55c9ebfeb30d84b96a002db1
ChatClientTest.java must import org.junit. It should appear near the top of the file, just after the package statement.\n\nRule #0 for this course: Do not modify anything except under the TODOs or you may break the app. If you have been making unauthorized changes, either change them back or download the app again and start over.
55c9eb06b30d843e96002dd7
Corrected. Thanks.

Hi VickyVicky1039,\n\nWelcome to the course. We are sorry to hear from you that you could not submit the assignment. The deadlines for assignment 1 and assignment 2 were due already. You cannot submit them beyond the deadline. Anyway, you don't have to worry because you can still pass the course as long as you get 60% of the scores in the course. So, missing one to two assignments does not really matter.\n\nWe hope you'll catch up and have good progress.

Hi ZohaibRashid,\n\nAs the deadline was already due, I don't think it is possible to extend the deadline. Please also be reminded that you don't need to get 100% of the scores to pass this course. As long as you get 60% of the scores, you can pass the course. So don't worry!

Get a new computer.\n\nSeriously, if your computer is too slow, too old, or you don't have enough memory, the emulator can take a long time to start, if it starts at all.\n\nYou may be able to upgrade your system, or it could be another problem, but I had to get a new computer just to install Android Studio. Now it runs great on my MacBook Air (8GB Ram, I7 processor, 256 GB SSD).\n\nYou can also just avoid the emulator entirely and use a real device instead. But a working emulator is nice.

Android Jellybean is API 17, but if you look in the build.gradle (Module: app) file of Assignment 2, you'll see:\n        \n    minSdkVersion 21\n    targetSdkVersion 22\n\nSo, you must reduce the minSdkVersion value to 17, and also make sure you have installed API 17 in the SDK Manager. \n\nWarning: this may break the app if it depends on functions that are not available in API 17, but it's worth a try to find out.\n\nAlternatively, upgrade your phone's software to API 21 or 22. This is probably not possible - Lenovo would have already pushed the upgrade to you if it were available. Again, it's worth a try. Contact Lenovo's website.

Another option is that you can use ARM instead of x86 or x86_64, because ARM does not require virtualization.\n\nFor example, I created a virtual machine with API 21 using Nexus One, and for CPU/ABI selecting ARM and almost always use that because it doesn't hang for hours for me like others I have tried.\n\nYou can check on your AVDs from Android Studio (with or without a project open) via <br />`Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager`\n\n- If you do not have ARM installed, you can get into the SDK manager with<br /> `Tools -> Android -> SDK manager` \n\n- Then scroll down the list to check if your desired API is installed (21 or 22 are needed to run our programs; I recommend using 21 because it is *much smaller* than 22)\n\n- So for API 21, you would scroll down to `Android 5.0.1 (API 21)`, and then below that look for `ARM EABI v7a System Image` and see if it says *Installed* or *Not Installed* \n	* if it is not installed, \n		* just put a `checkmark` next to it and click the white button labeled `INSTALL PACKAGES` at the bottom of the window. \n		* When it is done installing, close the SDK manager and follow the steps to get into the AVD manager and create an ARM avd (or you could instead edit one you have to use ARM instead)\n\nTo create an ARM emulator for API 21:\n\n- `Tools -> Android -> AVD manager`\n\n	- Click `+ Create Virtual Device` button at the bottom left of the screen <br />\n	- Scroll down the list to click on your desired device to emulate (I picked `Nexus One 3.7inch 480x800 hdpi` because a smaller screen is not as resource-intensive and therefore works better for me), then click blue `Next` button at bottom right of screen<br />\n	- Scroll down and click on `Lollippo **21** armeabi-v7a Android 5.0.1` and click on blue `Next` button at bottom right of screen <br />\n	- You can type in a different name to identify this AVD (if you type a name that is alphabetically before any other AVDs you have, then this one will be listed first, and it seems to default to the first one listed sometimes(?) or you can keep the one they have). Then click the blue `Finish` button at the bottom right of the page.\n\nNow when you go to run a program or a test, you can select this device which is guaranteed to be sufficient to do our class programs (because Prof Muppala specifically posted that we need only API 21 and can use any device that works on that, see Discussion forum thread "STAFF: WHY course minumum Nexus 5 API-21?" toward the bottom where he posts to say we only need API 21 NOT Nexus 5), and it will need a *lot* less memory to run, which hopefully will enable you to take the course!\n

From: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Adapter.html\n\npublic abstract View getView (int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent)\n\n"Get a View that displays the data at the specified position in the data set. You can either create a View manually or inflate it from an XML layout file. When the View is inflated, the parent View (GridView, ListView...) will apply default layout parameters unless you use inflate(int, android.view.ViewGroup, boolean) to specify a root view and to prevent attachment to the root."\n\nParameters\n\nposition - The position of the item within the adapter's data set of the item whose view we want.\n\nconvertView - The old view to reuse, if possible. Note: You should check that this view is non-null and of an appropriate type before using. If it is not possible to convert this view to display the correct data, this method can create a new view. Heterogeneous lists can specify their number of view types, so that this View is always of the right type (see getViewTypeCount() and getItemViewType(int)).\n\nparent - The parent that this view will eventually be attached to\n\nReturns\n\nA View corresponding to the data at the specified position.

55c86739a9a36e7006002f1b
You appear to have broken rule #0 for this course: DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PART OF A TODO. Otherwise you may break the app.\n\nThe app for the Week 2 assignment (assuming that is what you are working on) extends Activity in the ChatClient class. When you use a ListView in a subclass of Activity you can choose any id you want in the associated XML layout. For example, in this week's assignment the id is given by the line, android:id="@+id/messageList, in the file activity_chat_client.xml.\n\nBut if your activity extends ListActivity, for example in GreetFriend exercise, you are automatically provided with a ListView and a layout. If you want to provide your own layout the id MUST be android:id="@+id/List so the API can find it automatically.\n\nBut none of the above is specifically necessary to complete the assignment, except rule #0.\n\nSee also :\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3040374/runtimeexception-your-content-must-have-a-listview-whose-id-attribute-is-andro\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ListActivity.html\n\n

Ok, a quick bit of googling turned up [this stackoverflow post][1]. It looks like the main storage medium for an Android device is partitioned into a private internal storage for app settings and such, and a larger external storage for app data.

If your emulator is out of screen, press alt+space, you'll see options. Now type 'M' for Move. this will enable you to move the emulator window with your arrow keys. Once an arrow key is pressed, you can also move it with your mouse, it will be lock on it. to unlock your mouse, just double-click.

That's strange, are you using the emulator that was recommended for the course, the Galaxy Nexus? I guess it automatically created the external SD card, because I never had to manually create one. I don't know why the example bits of code I based this on favoured external storage over internal storage, perhaps someone with more experience in Android development could answer this?

55c79ddda9a36e5e21002df7
Can anyone please help with this issue?\n\nThanks!
55c88747a9a36eea62002e48
Have you looked at the logcat output? There will probably be a stack trace, which may give some indication what caused the error. \n\nAre you running the app on an actual device or an emulator?

Look at the logcat, the stack trace should give you a clue what caused the problem. Most likely it's a mismatch between the ids you've used in your java & the ones in your XML. 
55c86ea2a9a36e1d46002d98
By using the 2 different message layouts message.xml & mymessage.xml. All you need to do is use the right one depending on whether the message is one you typed in or is from the other party. The only file you need to make changes to is the one with the 2 TODOs inside the if/else statement.

Thanks Thomas, it was a new thing. I got stuck while running it on emulator. It was crashing at getExternalFilesDir(null) in ChatClient.java. On investigation, I found, that it is because emulator is missing, sdcard. To do the same, following steps were to be done:\n\na. create sdcard image \n$ mksdcard -l mysdcard 128M sdcard.img\n\nb. specify this in emulator command line option using Run->EditConfigurations\n-sdcard "sdcard.img"\nadd to this the path wherever it is available.\n\nc. Format this image after Emulator has started\n\nNow run, this crash is solved.

Make sure you follow the chat client exercise coding pattern exactly. You code might work but might fail the test too. If this is the case then follow the coding pattern in the lecture video. I was having the same problem until I changed my code to follow the pattern in the video. Am using genymotion and I passed the test!

The first link in Fernando_T's post links to the Testing Procedure. This tells you how to run the test case. If you look below the heading that says "Testing Procedure" and scroll down, it will step you thru setting up the configuration for the tests and then running them.

Hi Lawrence, unfortunately my knowledge of Android Studio is limited to what we have done so far in this course, so I don't think I can be of much help with this issue. However, as it is related to memory I suggest you first have a look at your code for any potential memory leaks and make sure you placed the code segments in the correct places.\n\nDid you modify the memory allocated to the AVD at all? If you did reduce it, you can try increasing it a bit to see if that fixes the problem.
55c57a10a9a36ea584002c6c
I don't understand the error you are getting, is it happening during compilation or after you open the app in the emulator?\n\nDouble check that your code related to the extraction of the zipped files is not missing anything. This would be the entire contents of ZipFileExtraction.java and the code segment placed into the onCreate method.\n\nIf that all looks good, then I would suggest you re-download bots.zip in case the first download was somehow corrupted. I slightly changed the instructions related to the downloads and creating the assets folder too, so have a look at that.
55c780a9b30d847d27002ceb
This might help... I had the layouts reversed so that the messages I typed were showing up on the right and the robot's messages were on the left. The assertion statements in the test force it to be the other way around. Once I swapped them I passed.\n\n-Paul
55c57a10a9a36ea584002c6c
when I run it according to the instructions, the app does not compile OK, I get an error decompressing the zip file, that is why I try that alternate process I mentioned before\n
55c80fdca9a36e4353002d03
I had the same issue on an AMD based system.  Make sure when you setup the virtual device that the ABI is not x86 and it will force the machine to emulate the hardware.\n\nHope that makes sense.

I had the same problem when I typed it out like the directions. I went back to watch the video and he highlights the string and drags it up to the line and that's how it becomes R.string.greetstring. \n\nMy Android studio didn't do that, instead it copied the actual text, but it ran anyway. How come copying and dragging does and doesn't convert it to R.string.greetstring? I was using my previous GreetFriend code, does that matter?
55c75326a9a36e315a002c93
Yes, you can do that, but there is a better technique using the ViewHolder Pattern to recycle the layout. \n\nSee: http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidListView/article.html#adapterperformance_holder

You do not have to change any files except MyArrayAdapter.java, and then only where you see the TODOs. If you change anything else you may break the app, which appears to be your problem.

I was actually having the same issue trying to use the emulator because I have an AMD processor, so I set out to use the program on my Samsung GS3 with KitKat 4.4.2. When I tried to run the program on my GS3, I got an error about something the version of my sdk/apk being older than specified. \n\nAfter googling that(the specific error message), I found where your API version is declared in another page in the project, and changed the 22 to a 19 for KitKat. I think I had one more error after that about a theme that was specific for higher APIs, so I just deleted the theme from one of the formatting pages in the project and everything worked great. The top toolbar was styled differently so I can see the change that deleting the theme made, but it was not significant to the functionality.\n\n**Edit: The place where I found to change the API version was under "Gradle Scripts" on the left and then build.gradle (Module: app)**\n\nI guess my point is, googling the error messages helped a lot for me and ultimately allowed me to finish the assignment and see it on my phone which was pretty cool to me, since that's not the way the project was set up and it took a little bit of "off-roading" and just figuring it out on my own. \n\nI understand that we will be working with features that are better to know now and specific to 21/22 and above, so I'm working on the emulator issue - but this is just something that worked for me. 
55c57a10a9a36ea584002c6c
Worked like a charm, thanks. This is a really great improvement!

The same thing happens to me - but only if I use the correct layout ... :-(
55c797bfb30d843537002c9c
I seem to be doing exactly the same thing wrong, but wasn't able to figure out what exactly it is ... :-( The code in the if and else statement seems to be working fine as it does well when I just put the message variante in both parts, but as soon as I try to put the reference to mymessage, it crashes. Any hint where to find my error?
55c7b2b6b30d844457002e81
The first Assignment was only 20% of the marks, the 2nd Assignment is due on Monday 10 Aug 2015 23:59 (GMT+8), check your timezone to work out exactly when that is for you. You only need 60% to pass the course, so it is still do-able, especially as you have previous experience. 
55c7abd9a9a36e7006002e88
The only things you should have changed are in MyArrayAdapter.java, under the 2 TODOs, therefore that is all the code you need to submit, plus the screenshot. Personally, I submitted the entire if/else statement encompassing the 2 TODOs just to put things into context and thanks to my gracious peers I got 100% for the assignment.
55c797bfb30d843537002c9c
Thanks, it was a simple error I was making regarding the different layout files.

This was super cool!\ngot it working, per your instructions, thank you.\n
55c797bfb30d843537002c9c
Did you look at the logcat messages? The stack trace may give you a clue what is causing the error. Check the IDs in your Java code match with those in the XML files.

Yes. I though that the ID's would be an issue, so I re-did the lab without changing the IDs, but the AOSP issue persists. I am using GenyMotion on an AMD computer if it makes any difference.
55c77967a9a36ebe32002bd1
The ChatClientTest.java should be exactly as it was downloaded. The only file you should make changes to is the one with the 2 TODOs in it, which is MyArrayAdapter.java. If you mess with anything else you may break stuff. 
55c780a9b30d847d27002ceb
You should not change any IDs. The only file you need to touch is the MyArrayAdapter.java, which has the 2 TODOs in it, and adapt your code to use the given IDs.
55c780a9b30d847d27002ceb
Update ... changed the code so that the IDs are the same as the download file, and the issue "Unfortunately, Android Keyboard (AOSP) has stopped." is still present.
55c780a9b30d847d27002ceb
Also, the emulator UI shows an error "Unfortunately, Android Keyboard (AOSP) has stopped. The test starts automatically starts typing in the emulator and the message above is generated after "This is a t".\n

55c765b2a9a36ee6f2002c7c
Check the layout IDs you are using are correct in your inflate statements.
55c765b2a9a36ee6f2002c7c
That's my main problem here:-\nWhy I see only message.xml listed, not the mymessage.xml? how to include the 2nd one in?\n
55c765b2a9a36ee6f2002c7c
The screenshot in your post is perfectly normal. If you left click on that icon you've highlighted you should see the 2 xml files listed.
55c758e5a9a36e7291002e9e
I got the same problem, the id in the message.xml can be related properly. But the id as in mymessage.xml, somehow it does not form the link. \n\nCan I know how to link it through? Thanks.
55c758e5a9a36e7291002e9e
Check the logcat output in Android Studio. You will hopefully see a stack trace which should give some indication what the problem is.\n\nMost likely one or more of the ids in your Java does not correspond with the ids in your XML.

As a fellow student I agree your review seems a little harsh, but there is actually a small bug in your code, the hour in is the range 0-23 and your if statement are missing out the first hour of the day. "hour >= 1" should be "hour >= 0" or changing the if statement to "if (hour > 21 || hour < 6)" would also work. Also moving the hard coded strings to a resource file would also be a good idea.

You have to leave bots.zip as a zipped file in the assets directory. This is because the assets directory is not permitted to contain sub-directories, only files. That is why the code is there to extract it once the application runs.\n\nWhen you get the response "I have no answer for that" it means that the bots folder cannot be seen by the program, so then it cannot match your message to any response.\n\nWhat happens when you try running it following the instructions? This wasn't the exact process I took to get it working but should be much more direct, however I may have missed something. I am going to try again from the beginning to see if I left anything out.\n

Many of the Android framework methods that we use are just the API provided by the framework. We just have to follow their specifications. So I just stick to saying do it this way without explanation. It's not like a logical science that we can explain with reasons why it should be done one way as opposed to another way. It's just the way that the framework expects us to write the code. Please also read the accompanying comments where I give some more details. My belief is that by doing the exercise we intuitively understand a lot more than trying to read all the documentation. Believe me, if you start reading all the documentation, you will never move forward. That's why my simple message is "Just do it!" Repeatedly doing the exercises while intuitively explaining to ourselves why we are doing the step helps us better understand the material. If you don't understand any step, just ask.

I do not have antivirus running while I use Android Studio on a class project (and I do turn it on again afterward! Antivirus sw was a very good thing to watch out for, thanks for reminding me). I must have forgotten to save it once, because it does usually save it correctly.\n\nI later discovered that you can set global encodings by using a similar procedure from the Android Studio main screen (with no projects open) and I've had no problems yet since trying that. Thank you for your help.

There's an error in your code. You are using the same layout in both cases.

Hello Thomas_91, same error happens to me when extracting the file. I tried extracting it manually and \nthen place "bots" in the assets folder, also I ignore the extraction code and just add:\n\nString path = getExternalFilesDir(null).getAbsolutePath();\n\nBot bot = new Bot(botname, path);\n\nchatSession = new Chat(bot);\n\nto onCreate() but when I run the app, the answer is the same in the app, says "I have no answer for that", so its kinda weird, hope you help us. Thanks for your time.\n\nPD1: I noticed that whenever I send a message, logcat says "No match"\n\nPD2: Adding the unzipped folders causes the app to crash when you send your first message

DiegoGp, you are not the one.\n\nI'm working hard on this course taking notes, reading developer's documentation, mind maps,etc. but many times Idn't understand the proceses or some constructors and mehods used during the development of apps.\n\nIn the videos, professor completes the code with (in my opinion) a lack of detailed information. I do it but I don't understand it well enough.\n\nPerhaps in a couple of weeks we can understand the whole code without problems.

The code structure to be used is best understood by looking at the SimpleChatClient app. If you understand how it works, then the assignment is straightforward.
55c61f1eb30d841bfd002d5c
These are Android framework methods that enable you to get some things accomplished. The Layout Inflater will take your XML layout file and construct the UI from it. The ArrayAdapter will map the string array values to the textviews in the list item layout. It's okay if you don't understand it completely. Just follow along the steps in the code. The detailed explanation of these methods can be found at the Android developer's site http://developer.android.com.

The extra space that you lack is probably the cause of why your tests failed. \n\nI think you should know about unit testing since you are so experienced with Java to know that a test would fail if they don't meet certain requirements. \n\nAnd to be a good programmer, knowing how to align your code is something important. Even though you know how to code, but... Is it readable? \n\nTrue, you might have less lines of codes in your program. However, would it be causing more difficulties for others to maintain your software someday? Or, when you leave your software for long periods of time, then suddenly when there's a time when you wanted to look back at what you have done, do you think you could read it with ease? \n\nThat is probably why that peer of yours rated you with a zero. I'm not sure, but just my two cents.

The problem is that we have been asked to complete the course in five weeks. This is the best schedule that we could offer at this stage. If the course is popular, then we'll ask for it to be offered in a self-paced manner. Even I'm having to run the course during our summer break when we normally are more busy working on our research :-( 
55c4eef8b30d848ec4002c8a

The Layout Inflater is used to create the layout from the XML file. The ArrayAdapter is used to map the string array to the List Item views. I intentionally did not go into the details, but just gave you the code which works. Getting into such details is too much for an introductory course. I don't want to overwhelm you with too much details while missing the whole point of doing the exercise. It's better to learn to use the standard code when you are beginning to learn Android. Once you get comfortable with writing simple applications, then you can explore the details.
55c5d423b30d8454c7002aae
I think the professor kinda *skimmed* over these concepts...  \n  Just see the exercise before the assignment and see how they are used and you're good to go (at least for the assignment)

Yes as a matter of fact when I just had one and first version (android-studio-bundle-141.1980579-windows) and it did the same.. then I actualized to the versión (android-studio-bundle-141.2117773-windows) and I have both, it (last) did the same.. actually after your kind email I have eliminated the first version and put the icon in the folder where i had the first version manually, is that right? I´ll taste it again..\n\nAs for genymotion I did that and also after open settings I had already opened browse repositories (as it said in the video of genymotion I remember) but when trying to emulate in GM it didn´t work.. \n\nWhen you say "make sure to download a virtual device" I don´t know what you meant but I´m gonna try and look for that function or action and let you know what happend, as always thanks for your time and helping me! ..

Efileno Kimchify You try it? Is it work with Amd? Fast? It will be good if this info about this emulator will be in pinned discussions with other known emulators like Genymotion, intel.\n\nI'm glad I could help!
55c4d792a9a36e7291002d75
Did you run your emulator & unlock it before running the test?

It is 21.

Your devices is running with an older release of Android than that being specified by minSDK in the manifest.xml file. May be you could modify the manifest.xml by modifying the minSdkVersion parameter according to the link below:\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html

To greglim and those with this problem:\n\nIf you run an intel processor machine and Windows, know that Android Studio won't install HAXM automatically it merely downloads it. You have to go to the Sdk directory (usually C:\users\<<username>>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk), locate the folder extra > intel and install it manually.\n\nIf you continue to receive this error, please check if Hyper-V is enabled in Windows. If so, uninstall it and try again. (Control Panel > Windows > Turn windows  features on or off > unselect Hyper-V)\n\nIf you run an AMD processor, HAXM won't work on Windows. You need to install a linux distribution alongside with your windows and install Android Studio for linux. \n\nThat was my case. So, I installed Elementary Os Freya in another partition. Then I installed jdk 7 via apt-get. After that, I downloaded Android Studio, unpacked it and runned ./studio.sh from bin folder. Finally, I followed all procedures in this site (SDK Manager) and now it works like a charm.\n\nHope this helps!\n

Ok, Acco. to your problem,you need to re install haxm manually. I written above how to do it. I was getting same error.
55c06f89b30d843e96002807
I think you should download it manually and intall on your system by placing it into appropriate location which is for Windows:"C:\Users\Shivam Pandey\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras\intel\" and if your getting another issues " try to use pre-installed version in android studio. I am using it and it working good and additionally i installed haxm only as stated above.

This is what you're gonna do. When you click on the  icon an it does all that again, allow it to finish. When it finishes, go into the location of the sdk and check if the sdk folder is not more than one. If it is more than one then delete the unnecessary ones. Now go and manually set the location of your sdk. By so doing, when next you click on the icon, it will not try to install sdk. For the genymotion, you have to install and enable the plugin in AS first![enter image description here][1]  After that, you'll be able to use it on AS. Make sure to download a virtual device of your choice in genymotion\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14389279122765898.png

Answered at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31536104/why-do-we-need-more-than-one-manifest-for-android-project\n\n"You usually would require more than one manifest file when you have more than one build type or product flavors.\n\n"Gradle merges all manifest files into a single manifest file. The merging priority is:\n - Product flavors and build types specific manifest files.\n - Main manifest file for the application.\n - Library manifest files.\n\n"Imagine the case where you have a free version and a paid version of your app. The root manifest file will have the segments shared by both the versions. The paid version would have the part specific for it, like checking license."\n\nReference: http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/manifest-merger\n\n[answered Jul 21 at 10:51 by Udit Mukherjee]

I think you have dragged a TextView object instead of an EditText object. I'd recommend you going back to the video and see exactly where an EditText object could be located.

If you have successfully launched it before, yet it is not working now, you could try to close some application to free some memory. If you have never launched it before, I guess you could check the pinned threads, there should be a solution for you. In general it could be because of memory problem, graphics driver problem, or other software related problems.

If you start the intent, I think only the "ShowMessage" activity in the "running" stage,  the "MainActivity" is in the "OnPause" stage.

I've said the following in a number of course forums (to no avail): there should be an edX Best Practices document.  It would include the recommendation for discussion links on every page (or those links should just be automated in), so you can hone in on a particular topic without wading through tons of messages.  If I have a a problem *on this page*, then I just go to the discussion link *for this page*.  In the current setup, we have a whole load of PINNED messages, one of which says "read these PINNED messages" before posting questions.  If the Search function worked well, perhaps that would be workable.\n\nOther edX Best Practices ideas have included a way to refer to "pages" and entity naming conventions.  I've seen the "main entries on the left" as being WEEKS, MODULES, TOPICS, etc.  Why not standardize these terms and adopt a naming convention for referring to "pages"?
55c35744b30d84bdd2002b7e
If you mean the first assignment, the submit date has already passed. But don't give up hope, you only need 60% to pass the course and each of the 5 assignments is worth 20%, so if you do well in the remaining 4 you can still pass. Assignment 2 has a due date of Monday 10 Aug 2015 23:59 (GMT+8), that's Hong Kong time so don't forget to correct for your timezone.

Do you have a **anti-virus running** when android studio is running?  If one is indexing (studio) and the other is validating all new files written (anti-virus) then they could be playing catch with your files.  If you do have the anti-virus running, try turning it off before starting up the Android studio.\n\nObviously you would want to **turn back on** the anti-virus after you were done in the studio.

http://tools.android.com/knownissues/encoding\n\nThis might be a known issue.  They seem to say keep setting the encoding every time you see the error.\n\nDoes the project not save as UTF-8 after you change the setting?\n\nOn my mac conversions seem to work fine and I do not get these issues...  interesting.\n\nAlso if android studio is running amok it is most likely because its indexing. You might try searching for a way to stop it from doing that.  I could only find odd posts to the net on that subject.
55c08e78b30d849956002928
did you make sure you could see the screen shot that you uploaded?  If you cannot see the screenshot, chances are that even though you uploaded it, something failed. If you can see it when you upload it next time take a screen shot as there may be something else wrong.  At least then you know you know.

 **Xianan:** What is your OS? Version? RAM? and free HDD space?  the Android studio is a resource hog.  Try reading through the pinned discussion posts to reduce the memory size of everything and see if that doesn't help.\n\nAlso remember the emulator is a linux VM running android OS.  So it is really like you have a cell phone on your computer.  It may want to reboot itself a few times and takes a really long time to startup initially just like you cell.\n
55c23175a9a36e1b22002b5e
**ubrmax:** Appearantly it has something to do with the skin if you are using the emulator that was suggested by the course. (AVD?) The nexus 5 (five) skin doesn't have any buttons on the side.  The default skin seems to if you create a custom profile.\n\nHere is information about creating a skin for the emulator:\nhttp://developer.android.com/tools/devices/managing-avds.html#skins\n\nIf you just want to choose a skin for the profile you made then click the *advanced options* and then click the *skin dialogue* as shown below.  These options are configured after you choose the hardware profile when you are making a new one.  I was able to get the view you are looking at as well as the Nexus 5 skin that doesn't have those buttons.  It would be nice if there was a "hide/show" feature for them.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438849971121222.png\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14388499891191943.png

**tongkiat:**  Great ideas! \n\nThe real evaluation will come when you independently create your own app.  That is honestly the only grade that matters.  Open classes unfortunately will always be prone to cheating and problems.  For those of us who want to learn they still offer a lot.\n\nGet out and program something, that is the most impressive thing to any employer.

Since the submission date is over, I think it should be okay to post the answers right?  If not, can the moderators please let me know and remove my response, please?  Thanks.\n\nAlso, I don't know what the model answer is, this is just what I have.  Please let me know if you spot any bug, or if you've any suggestion to improve the code.\n\n        --------------------NO CHANGES REQUIRED ABOVE--------------------\n        // TODO 1  <-- this is line 68 in the original MainActivity.java\n        // Add the code to display the appropriate greeting message. Your output message should be exactly the same as the one you see on the video with exactly the same number of spaces in the same positions.\n        // The code from the previous exercise is commented and kept below for your reference\n        switch (v.getId()) {\n            case R.id.greetButton:\n                // use the provide code snippet to get the hour of the day\n                Date date = new Date();\n                Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();\n                cal.setTime(date);\n                int hour = cal.get(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY);\n\n                String greeting = "";    // type of greeting, e.g., "Good Morning ", "Good Afternoon ", "Good Evening ", "Good Night "\n\n                // Since those greetings are already stored in the res/values/strings.xml that is provided, we'll use those string resources\n                if (hour >= 6 && hour < 12) {\n                    greeting = getString(R.string.goodmorning);\n                } else if (hour >= 12 && hour < 17) {\n                    greeting = getString(R.string.goodafternoon);\n                } else if (hour >= 17 && hour < 21) {\n                    greeting = getString(R.string.goodevening);\n                } else if (hour >= 21 || hour < 6) {\n                    greeting = getString(R.string.goodnight);\n                }                                                                                                                       \n                // set the string being displayed by the TextView to the greeting\n                // message for the friend\n                textMessage.setText(greeting + friendName + "!");\n                break;\n            default:\n                break;\n        }\n        --------------------NO CHANGES REQUIRED BELOW--------------------\n\nIn retrospect, I could have set greeting as an int, instead.  That would then remove four "getString"s, and add one getString at the textMessage method.  That is, instead of writing something like\n\n    greeting = getString(R.string.goodmorning);\n\nI only need to write\n\n    greeting = R.string.goodmorning;  // simpler!\n\nand instead of\n\n    textMessage.setText(greeting + friendName + "!");\n\nI'd have\n\n    textMessage.setText(getString(greeting) + friendName + "!");    // slightly more complex, though\n\nPlease let me know if you still do not understand.\n\nI think the greatest (an almost insurmountable) challenge was to set up the whole thing.  If you manage to get the code to compile and run in Android Studio, congratulations!  Frankly, if I were to decide, setting up the proper development environment is worth at least 20 points!  :-)

I was also unable to submit the assignment since I downloaded the "GreetFriend.zip" in which the test file was wrong with "Good Day John" and there was no "Good Day" string in the assignment. Later I downloaded "TimeGreetFriend.zip" and successfully passed the test but the deadline was passed. So couldn't submit the assignment. \nNow the "Assess Peers" is inactive.

Dear Vectorspace,\n\nI have upgraded my system and so far everything works fine.\nAlthough I had some problems when I tried to use my Sony mobile for testing -> Windows 10 didn't recognize it (in device manager). It was working fine in Android Studio before the upgrade. The solution was to download Sony Companion software and it installed the correct Windows 10 driver for my Android device.\n\nHope this helped,\nPeter

Ricardo,\nI believe I figured it out. I unzipped the GreetFriend file into a folder, and selected this new folder. To get a Gradle build, I navigated one level lower when importing, and the Gradle build proceeded as expected. In short, one has to select the folder at the right level to get the gradle build to work correctly. I assumed it would navigate the folder higherarchy and identify the correct files automatically.\nJohn

According to the rubric, \n> - Submitted code attempts to check for the time interval “At or after 9 pm and before 6 am” using appropriate Java conditional statement(s).\n- The statement does not need to be 100% correct in terms of the Java language. It is acceptable as long as a check is present.\n\nAs such, you should still get full marks.  Or at least, I would have given you the full marks for your "Good Night" conditional branch.

I think that for as long as the course is advertised from edX and people like me subscribe later, they should be given the possibility to submit with a more generous window for at least the first week. With regards to the peer review, it could still be done amongst the wave of the late joiners no need to disrupt the others.\nIf you want to be strict about submission then you have to be so also for the possibility of enrolment. I should not have been allowed on the course when I subscribed yesterday.\n

The peer grading mechanism was chosen after many serious considerations. We wanted to develop some auto code grader to grade assignments. However, it involves high complexity to check and grade Android code because its footprint, dependent libraries. Also, we found grading one submission might take 30-60 minutes with a such code grader due to the slowness of emulator and the android platform. For a course with thousands of students, the auto code grader became impractical, unless we will have a better solution to implement it. \n\nWe also considered to do semi-automatic grading, with some manual processing. However, this platform cannot support this idea at all. \n\nPeer assessment is the best one among our available options. 
55bfa7a0b30d8463fc002bc7
Saad97, can you see your uploaded image now? I asked because I found the platform doesn't show your image to me. \n\nBy the way, I looked at the evaluations you received. 3 peers provided you grades. One of the evaluation didn't follow our intended rubric. Another peer gave you his evaluation reasonably. Although you received a poor score in the one last evaluation, your peer did give you his comments explaining what he expected from your code, reasoning his evaluation. He expected a more strictly defined printing format of a greeting message (which is a good as being a programmer). I would say he holds a higher standard than the norm, but his observations are valid. \n\nHope you don't mind and don't lose heart in learning. And I hope you find reading evaluations could help you learn something as well. \n\nIn my experience assisting in another programming course, we used machine grading to automatically grade code submissions. The machine is less human and would only tells you correct or wrong, by judging on very tiny issue, for example an extra space. So, there are always goods and bads with any grading mechanism.

55c06f89b30d843e96002807
How is it possible to deliver correct code as required in the assignment and still get downgraded because of a peer opinion on code convention instead of functionality. I think the peer review is great but as a grading mechanism it is not working. Please consider what you are doing.

Soy Colombiano, como van con el segundo assignment?

open sdk manager and in extra check HAXM and install. it will download it then go to your folder of sdk -> extra you will find setup file. click it to install\n

If you try running your project you will see that there is already code in the project to do that. Look at the sendMessage method in ChatClient.java.
55c08084b30d84c9b8002a3f
In your screenshot, the first line is underlined with red, meaning that android studio thinks it is wrong.  Have you declared the greetButton variable before? If not, this would cause both the red underlining and the autocomplete not working. If you have declared it, find first why that line is underlined as with error, correct it, and then check if autocomplete works.
55c0c4e3a9a36e88ff002913
If the assignment hadn't finished, you would be presented with the solutions of other students and would be asked to mark them (give them points if they are correct or no points if they were wrong). So you don't lose that much in practice if you can't access it, although it is nice seeing how the other students resolved the problem.

Hi wapjude,\n\nYou may refer to this [link][1] for the GreetFriendApp.\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/234fa80753b1476592ae17d37b17bb9e/86af56609a234b5088e74069fb35ac87/

Thanks , this solved the problem for me as well.\n\nBut this seems to be poor test case design, what if I missed the deal line because of that ?\n
55c06f89b30d843e96002807
I was also unable to submit the first assignment, although I have successfully completed it.\nDue to some security restrictions and the importance of the development environment that I must keep preserved on my main SO (used mainly for Hardware(FPGA)/Software development and Security Testing/Consulting related tasks), at this moment and due to the high importance of my professional deadlines/objectives, I cannot afford changes to the health of this system. Since this is my laptop and the only computer, the only way to follow this course is to install Android Studio in a virtual machine, which I discover too late, does not allow the HAXM to be installed.\nIn my case, I am able to do the debug on my personal device...and sincerely, I prefer this way.\nBut testing the assignment one on the device launches the exception\n\nandroid.support.test.espresso.PerformException: Error performing 'single click' on view 'with id: hk.ust.cse.comp107x.timegreetfriend:id/greetButton'.\nat android.support.test.espresso.PerformException$Builder.build(PerformException.java:83)\nat android.support.test.espresso.base.DefaultFailureHandler.getUserFriendlyError(DefaultFailureHandler.java:70)\nat android.support.test.espresso.base.DefaultFailureHandler.handle(DefaultFailureHandler.java:53)\nat android.support.test.espresso.ViewInteraction.runSynchronouslyOnUiThread(ViewInteraction.java:184)\nat android.support.test.espresso.ViewInteraction.doPerform(ViewInteraction.java:115)\nat android.support.test.espresso.ViewInteraction.perform(ViewInteraction.java:87)\nat hk.ust.cse.comp107x.timegreetfriend.MainActivityTest.testChangeText(MainActivityTest.java:40)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\nat java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:372)\n(...continues)\n\nwhich, after some time, I was able to solve inserting a 'Thread.sleep(1000);' in the MainActivityTest.java, line 40 (solution provided in https://code.google.com/p/android-test-kit/issues/detail?id=44).\n\nAccording to the discussion forum, there are many problems that are affecting people.\nI think it would be valuable that this first assignment deadline could be extended by one or two day to allow this people deal with their problems and submit the assignment.\nOther solutions could be the creation of an additional assignment that can be submitted by people, which wishes to compensate the final grade, eventually, ignoring the worst assignment value to the final grade.\nI'm a IT engineer with many years of experience in Hardware/Software/Security development, testing and consulting. I was not expecting to have so much trouble to make all things work together for this MOOC, and sincerely, it seems that neither the staff nor the published material faces the many initial problems that seem to affect other students.
55bf0b00a9a36eb142002841
I was able to solve my errors. My errors were:\n\nError (#,#) Failed to resolve...  \nandroidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:runner:0.2'  \nandroidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test:rules:0.2'  \nandroidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:2.1'  \nandroidTestCompile 'com.android.support.test.uiautomator:uiautomator-v18:2.1.0'\n\nI followed LamAlex's advice:  \n"Make sure you have downloaded the latest "Android Support Repository" and "Android Support Library" in the "Extras" folder of the SDK manager."
55bfae7fb30d848f10002b36
That's exactly what I used to do with Eclipse and ADT (before Android Studio) - the emulator was unusable on my old computer. Then I found that I couldn't install Android Studio at all! \n\nSo I got a refurbished 2013 model of the MacBook Air (8 GB RAM, 256GB SSD, I7 processor) from Apple for 25% less than the price of the new one. I'm 100% satisfied. Amazingly fast and looks brand new! Of course the memory and processor upgrades are crucial, but the reviews say that the SSD's short access time and fast data rate also contribute.\n\nSee: http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/macbook_air/13\n\n

Yeah thats what the site said but if they want to play it like that, then come on buddy lets settle this on soccer field! :(\nI would have deducted the marks of four out of five of my peers because of some careless mistakes but because I just had to check whether they mentioned the testing condition or not I gave them full marks\n\n
55bfa7a0b30d8463fc002bc7
i mentioned my code below and check my reply to LamAlex statement. :)

I was unable to submit my assignment. First I had a problem with HelloWorld. I never was able to run it due to an error:\nemulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!\nPlease ensure Intel HAXM is properly installed and usable.\nSecondly I had error with Greeting Exercise.The system gets frozen while working in the adding a text field into the designer.\nI tried on a Windows 8.1 PC with 8GB of ram and 1TB Hard disk and on a Windows 7 PC with 8GB of ram and 200 GB of disk. Both are modern PCs.\nThanks\n\n
55bfa7a0b30d8463fc002bc7
Well dude, I'll tell you that my program code was perfectly utilising the very principles of if-else if statement and checking the hour and giving the output. One of the graders gave me the marks for my code but the other two didn't with one saying that I gave an extra space before exclamation marks as the reason for giving me a zero.\nWhy the other did it I don't know? :(\nThis is my code:-\nswitch (v.getId()) {\n            case R.id.greetButton:\n                if(hour < 12 && hour >= 6)\n/* it's the same as checking whether its greater than 6 first and checking it's less than 12 cause I've used and*/\n                    textMessage.setText("Good Morning " + friendName + " !");\n            if(hour < 17 && hour >= 12)\n                textMessage.setText("Good Afternoon " + friendName + " !");\n            if(hour < 21 && hour >= 17)\n                textMessage.setText("Good Evening " + friendName + " !");\n            if(hour > 21 && hour <=24 || hour < 6 && hour >=0)\n                textMessage.setText("Good Night " + friendName + " !");\n            break;\n            default:\n                break;\n        }\nNow tell me where am I wrong?\n

Yes, I tried reloading the page; but it does not appear at all.Comments field for EXPLICIT CHECK FOR THE AFTERNOON TIME INTERVAL continues to be missing.
55c06f89b30d843e96002807
Yes, it is the same assignment 1, since you have missed it, I think you do not need to mark the submissions for the peers. Under the Edx system, we are unable to make changes to that.

Sir, I was unable to submit the assignment because I couldn't download HAXM and some other tools. I'm an IT student in a company but the internet of the company has restrictions, I can only do a few things with it.
55bf0b00a9a36eb142002841
Totally! I started the assignment late due to my processor not supporting HAXM, had to get a new one. Now I completed assignment but can't submit it. Hope examiners extends due date 1 day.

Dear LamAlex,\nI was unable to submit my first assignment because of an error coding and running program. Now,the peer assignment is unavailable in my courseware.

Hi DoudouZhou,\n\nyou may try fixing the error in the code view first. Android Studio already provides pop-up hints for you to fix the problems. In case it doesn't work, you may try re-downloading the project and re-importing it. Make sure you don't mistakenly delete any required files in the project. Otherwise, it may cause problems.

Irenna, we are trying to be generous in the first assignment. So if you follow the rubric, as long as an "attempt" (not necessarily correct) has been made to check for the time (indicating that he/she is aware of performing a check), the rubric considers that okay.
55bf835bb30d847d270027f3

We have to follow some guidelines for pre-scheduled courses. If this course is well received, we'll ask for it to be turned into a self-paced course so that it will give as much flexibility to the learners as possible. From our side we have no problem releasing all the materials, since they are all ready (were ready about a month in advance). However we have to abide by the guidelines.
55bfa7a0b30d8463fc002bc7
We have factored in the issue that there will be some rogue students who will purposefully mark incorrectly. That's why each assignment has at least three graders and it's averaged. So even if one misbehaves, this will be factored out as much as possible. This is a problem with any large-scale assessment systems relying on peers. So don't lose heart. The assessment mechanism we use will reduce the impact of such behavior.
55c03788b30d846a86002836
Could you create an AVD based on the ARM processor and see if this solves the problem?
55c02824a9a36e2f6d002891
Are you asking about your assignment?  Apparently we are unable to see your submission? Did you press the submit button?
55bfa792b30d84c9b800297f
The differences in peer assessment levels is going to be a problem for a lot of people. I would have given the OP full marks as the only requirement was to have checked explicitly for the time range, even if the Java wasn't perfect. 3 of my 5 reviews made bigger mistakes than this and I still gave them full marks. \n\n(Those 3 people only had images of a passed test because the test wasn't very thorough, it only tested the time at which the test was run, so loads of people with errors could still pass. A good test program would have let the OP know that his/her program was incorrect)
55bf2f77b30d8468500028cc
Are you sure? In my MainActivity.java file, the TODO is right there in the onClick method.
55bf22e5a9a36e4e4e002784
Hard to say, but a desktop will generally outperform a laptop, so either should be more than satisfactory.
55bf1feda9a36e86bc002805
Thanks, it was getting pretty annoying reading about the same problems over and over again...

Here is the original rationale for the XML version of onClick, way back in Android 1.6:\n\nFrom: http://android-developers.blogspot.ca/2009/10/ui-framework-changes-in-android-16.html\n\n"Setting up a click listener on a button is very common task, but it requires quite a bit of boilerplate code:\n\n    findViewById(R.id.myButton).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            // Do stuff\n        }\n    });\n\n"One way to reduce the amount of boilerplate is to share a single click listener between several buttons. While this technique reduces the number of classes, it still requires a fair amount of code and it still requires giving each button an id in your XML layout file:\n\n    View.OnClickListener handler = View.OnClickListener() {\n        public void onClick(View v) {\n            switch (v.getId()) {\n                case R.id.myButton: // doStuff\n                    break;\n                case R.id.myOtherButton: // doStuff\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    findViewById(R.id.myButton).setOnClickListener(handler);\n    findViewById(R.id.myOtherButton).setOnClickListener(handler);\n\n"With Android 1.6, none of this is necessary. All you have to do is declare a public method in your Activity to handle the click (the method must have one View argument):\n\n    class MyActivity extends Activity {\n        public void myClickHandler(View target) {\n            // Do stuff\n        }\n    }\n\n"And then reference this method from your XML layout:\n\n    <Button android:onClick="myClickHandler" />\n\n"This new feature reduces both the amount of Java and XML you have to write, leaving you more time to concentrate on your application."\n\n***************\n\nAnother advantage of the XML version is given here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/4570838/any-disadvantage-of-androidonclick-attribute-usage?rq=1\n\n"android:onClick has a major advantage in addition to being less code - it's part of a layout resource. The resource is selected at runtime depending on the current configuration of the device. Some parts of your UI might use different variants of the same layout depending on whether the device is in landscape/portrait mode, has a different screen size, etc. In a situation like this you can use onClick attributes on each element to wire things up appropriately rather than a lot of code to determine what elements are present at runtime."\n\n****************\n\nA disadvantage of the XML version is given here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4153517/how-exactly-does-the-androidonclick-xml-attribute-differ-from-setonclicklistene\n\n"[The XML version] uses Java Reflection to invoke the callback method defined in our Activity. Here are the reason for issues mentioned in other answers:\n\n- Callback method should be public : Since Java Class getMethod is used, only functions with public access specifier are searched for. Otherwise be ready to handle IllegalAccessException exception.\n- While using Button with onClick in Fragment, the callback should be defined in Activity : getContext().getClass().getMethod() call restricts the method search to the current context, which is Activity in case of Fragment. Hence method is searched within Activity class and not Fragment class.\n- Callback method should accept View parameter : Since Java Class getMethod searches for method which accepts View.class as parameter."

Hi Ricardo,\nI understand that I have to choose project (it says this in the video), but when I do, the appropriate folders are not visible.  ![enter image description here][1] Also, I get errors associated with not having a gradle build - this was not created with a Gradle build etc.. Note that when I follow the video, I do not get the same processing window for the Gradle build. However, I do get the Gradle build when I open the first project created per the video, HelloWorld.\nPlease advise what I might try.\nJohn G\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14386562574374178.jpg

@ChallR, it sounds like the thing you need to do may be to set the path in the environmental variables so that Android Studio knows how to find your java:\n\n- If you DID download a Java JDK of version 7 or higher, but Android Studio is giving you an error that it cannot find a valid Java installation:\n	1. Check to see if you have it. Possible ways to do this are:\n		- if you have your control panel organized in the pre-Windows-7 way, there will be a Java folder in it to configure the Java you have installed\n		- In Win 7 you can do Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features\n			and it should have an entry something like Java 8 Update 45 (or Java 7 something)\n		- Start Menu - type JAVA SDK in the text box at the bottom. It should show an icon that says "java sdk" if it is installed\n	2. Once you have it, find out and save the path where it is installed, so you can set it up to be found by Android Studio\n		- find it. Mine is in C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45. I pulled up a Windows Explorer window and checked in C:\Program Files (if not there, check C:\Program Files (x86) too), found Java, and then found jdk1.8.0_45\n		- **NOTE: although the actual executables like javac.exe are in the BIN directory under the Java\jdk___ directory, the program just wants the path name of the JDK directory, not the bin directory.**\n\n	3. Set it up to be found by Android Studio by creating an environment variable as follows:\n		- Start menu > click on: Computer > look at top and click on System Properties > Advanced System Settings. \n		- Then open \n			- Advanced tab > click on button at bottom: Environment Variables, then \n			- add a new system variable JAVA_HOME \n				- that points to your JDK folder, \n					\n				- do this by looking at the bottom half "system variables", click "NEW"\n					- for variable name, **type the name in all capital letters**: JAVA_HOME\n					- for variable value, put your jdk directory (e.g. mine was C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45)\n			- If this worked, then click OK at the bottom, and OK again; and after you restart your Android Studio, it should find it now\n			- `if it tells you that you do not have permission to add system variables`, then **instead add a user variable**:\n				- Go to the top half "user variables for username", and click "NEW"\n					- for variable name, **type the name in all capital letters**: JAVA_HOME\n					- for variable value, put your jdk directory (e.g. mine was C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_45)\n					- If this worked, then click OK at the bottom, and OK again; and after you restart your Android Studio, it should find it now\n\n

Also, although we are essentially building on the GreetFriend app that we worked on in class, make sure to download the TimeGreetFriend app and work on it for our homework. It has extra stuff in it that we need.

BTW, I have tested the app on different times by manually changing the time in the emulator, and it worked just fine. I also tried to restart the emulator and Android Studio, but the results of running the test are always the same...

Unfortunately, the edx software does not provide a way to change due dates for code submitted for peer-review.\n\nI know what you mean, I was watching this deadline for days and converting from UTC (which edx specifies times are supposed to be given in), when apparently it is not GMT/UTC but GMT-8 or something, which is Hong Kong time. I almost missed the deadline but was lucky.\n\nOne place where they will show an accurate countdown to the actual due date is in the actual place where we are to submit our code and our peer reviews:\n\n![Place to check for comprehensible due dates][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14386532509612287.jpg

You can change your API level from Android Studio by getting into the AVD manager (Tools -> Android -> AVD Manager) and then either editing a device/phone you have there by clicking on the pencil icon next to its name, or creating a new device, and select a device with API 21\n\nIf you need to use less memory, choose a armeabi-v7a` (instead of the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64 we were initially recommended)\n\nIf you do not have armeabi-v7a installed, then (DO THIS STEP WHEN YOU HAVE TIME TO DOWNLOAD SOFTWARE THAT MIGHT TAKE A HALF HOUR, like before you go to bed at night) go to the SDK manager (Tools -> Android -> SDK manager) and put checkmarks next to the two API 21 ARM entries (I think they're toward the bottom but I can't check right now bc I am compiling), and click "install" at the lower right of the page. This will take some time and install the needed software. Once it completes, you can then create a device with ARM (armeabi-v7a).

I had the same problem yesteday and I've missed the deadline too. In my case the problem was because of the Avast. I had to untick "Enable hardware-assisted virtualization", it is in the Avast in settegins > Troubleshooting. Then reboot and I was able to install HAXM without a problem.\n\n

I consider peer assessments that are part of your grade idiotic.  I love the idea of my peers giving me honest feedback and helping each other learn the best way to work through the assignments, but to have any random person have unwarranted control over my grade is wrong. I understand the need for peer assessment considering the number of people taking the online classes, but any peer assessment should be able to be contested and reviewed by a teacher or TA who is ultimately responsible for the students grade.
55bcdd70a9a36eb14200270e
@KMurali607, Don't give up!\n\n- You don't have to run HAXM or use hardware acceleration:\n\n- You don't have to run API 22 (which is something huge like 16G)\n	- To run our programs you just have to run API 21 and pick a device\n	- You can pick a device with a physically smaller screen\n	- You can pick a device that needs less processing, like API 21 Nexus One\n\n- You can still use `API 21` as required by the course projects, but select \n`armeabi-v7a` (instead of the slower memory hogs `x86_64` or `x86`), by:\n\n	- Get into the Android SDK \n	- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n	- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n	- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (e.g. does not require virtualization):\n		- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n		- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n		- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  	OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n		- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n		- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n		- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n\n- You can still pass the course; missing this assignment you can still get 80% in the course, and we only need 60% to pass

Hi Lyubomyr,\n\nIf you have been going through the lectures and doing the exercises, you should have the "Greet Friend" app completed. The assignment is to modify the code of this app so that the greeting is time-dependent (i.e. it says "Good morning" during morning hours, "Good afternoon" during afternoon hours, or "Good evening" during evening hours).\n\nJust to make sure... you want to install ANDROID STUDIO, not arduino (android is for mobile engineering; arduino is for controls engineer). \n

Hi Subbu003,\n\nI have tested the the devices in a notebook (i7 and 4Gb RAM) with Debian and Linux Mint, which is based on ubuntu. For virtualization I'm using qemu-kvm.\n\nIn spite of the intensive use of processor and memory of Android Studio, your machine must be capable of running it.\n\nInstead of nexus5 you can use the galaxy nexus or try some devices with lower resolutions and memory under AVD settings.

This will be prevalent in any peer review scenario.  Some people just want to behave in a manner that isn't productive and you will never stop that.   That is the major issue with peer review.  Students in this class are not actually at the same level as other students.\n\nedX knows this but until there are better methods to score programming course, this will be the norm.\n\nI hope the course authors have at least factored in the ability to drop a certain number of the lowest scores to offset this errant behavior by the few trolls who partake in these courses.

This should not happen. But I think you could try to search for the ".gradle" folder in the project directory.

how many peers deducted the marks from you because of the spaces? We have explicitly written on the rubric that as long as the submission "attempts" to do a task, it should considered a pass...

TurnerTmorris, you are posting this for twice, I can feel your frustration, but just as I have replied you in another thread, it is almost certain that not all of you would feel comfortable with Android studio as it is in fact quite demanding on the hardware and also on the time you are willing to spend. We all have gone through that. But once you have got through it with your endurance, when you look back, you will realize how much fun you have in fact enjoyed. \n\nI think your classmate RicardoAbian is correct: "Don't be discouraged!"

I have seen a few people posting about their experiences with Linux Mint, which obviously is different than Ubuntu, but maybe if you put "Linux Mint" in the "Search all posts" box at the top left of the Discussions board, their articles may help?\n\nAlso, if you select armeabi-v7 instead of x86 or x86_64 emulators, it does not require hardware acceleration and takes up less memory so may be feasible.

You might be able to download ONLY API 21 with ARM and be small enough.\n\nProf. Muppala says if we want to run the programs he uses, we have to have API 21.\n\nIf you might be able to fit JUST the one API 21, the way to do it would be this:\n\n- open Android Studio\n\n- From the top, click on "`Tools`" then select "`Android`" then select "`SDK Manager`"\n\n- Scroll down to the "`Android 5.0.1 (API 21)`" section\n\n- if it is not already opened up to show its contents, `click the triangle icon to the left of "Android 5.0.1 (API 21)"`\n\n- I am guessing about this part because I am not sure if you need all of these or just one, but for which files of these you decide to download, `click the box on their left to select each one`\n\n	- ARM EABI v7a System Image\n	- Google APIs ARM EABI v7a System Image\n\n- Once you have ticked the box next to each one you want to download, the lower right will show what packages it is ready to install (and optionally delete)\n\n- Click on the "`Install`" button at the lower right, which will install the packages you selected\n\n- Once it is installed, get into the AVD manager ( `Android Studio -> Tools -> Android -> AVD manager` ) and follow the steps to set up a device, making sure to select `armeabi-v7a` instead of the larger and more-RAM-intensive `x86` or `x86_64`.\n\n	- Alternatively, once you download  ARM and have successfully compiled and run and tested a program to completion with it, you might be able to use SDK manager again and uninstall x86 and x86_64 (if you had installed them) to save space.\n\n

It *is* okay, because each of time check rubrics says this, "The statement does not need to be 100% correct in terms of the Java language. It is acceptable as long as a check is present."
55bf94d9a9a36eb1420028a1
anon, the one reliable place I have found to check the deadline is on the actual submission page; before the deadline closed it had a countdown to how many hours/minutes in which it was due.\n\nI had been checking this deadline for days and mistakenly from GMT thinking that meant it was Greenwich Mean Time/UTC, which apparently it's not, and had a nasty shock this morning (but I was lucky).\n\n![Place to check for countdown to deadlines][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14386213305595987.jpg

This is a snippet from Prof. Muppala for your reference:\n\n"We cannot extend the deadline because the entire course is structured to finish as per the specified deadlines announced at the beginning of the course. That's the reason we give students an extra week (the first week) to sort out Android studio issues and give one more week to finish the first assignment."

Get lots of memory and as fast a processor as you can afford. I am using 8GB RAM and and a 2-year old Intel I7 processor in a MacBook Air (in other words, not the most powerful processor) and everything works fine. A newer Intel I5 should be OK too.\n\nUp until a couple of months ago, I used an 8-year old MacBook, very slow, only 1GB of RAM. It worked with the older Android ADT and Eclipse, but the emulator was unusable. Instead I used only real devices for testing. Even so, I got a lot of work done on it. I'm in this course just to get up to speed on Android Studio, which I could not even install on my old machine.\n\n

On Android Studio (and many other ides) you can type #TODO in places where you want to fill out later, don't want to forget etc. The IDE then keeps track of them and it tells you for example that you have 1 or more of them. In homework, it is used by the professors to let us know where we have to put our code.
55bf743ba9a36e5e210028b1
screenshot accounts for 1/5 of the assignment score. Sure, you can submit the code only.\nFor AMD processor, in fact if you have read the pinned articles, you could create an AVD with ARM as the processor.

is totally okay, i did that in the past.but one thing is very important.NEVER NEVER miss out any task.If you miss the first week you only will have max 80% one more 60%.As you can see miss out 2 means you have great chance to fail.So good luck

You can downsize Android studio by installing only what you need as the course proceeds (and removing things that are no longer needed). \n\nHere's a screen shot of my Android Studio installation (on a Mac ... a PC will look slightly different). As you can see, most of the total 14GB+ of space is taken up by API 22 (over 8 GB!). So far we are using only API 21, which needs less than 2 GB. You can uninstall APIs in the SDK manager.\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14386101133537724.jpg

You have a total of 5 assignments, each of which carries the same amount of scores. For assignment 1, even if your Android studio is not working, if you manage to formulate the code without it, you could still be getting credits. Only the screenshot would require a fully functional Android studio and emulator and this part accounts for 1/5 of the total scores of assignment 1, which accounts for 1/5 of the course overall scores. You just need to get 60% of the overall scores to get a "pass". 
55bf2f77b30d8468500028cc
A TODO is simply a reminder of a task that is not complete yet, as in a "to do list" of daily chores you might write to yourself. Android Studio has provided support to make it easy to find TODOs embedded in the code, which is especially useful in larger programs where they are easy to miss.

Just copy and paste the code you added below the //TODO label and then upload the automated test result screenshot(remember to click on the "upload your image" button). Check very carefully to make sure everything is correct before you submit.

Try registering and see what happens. If you succeed then your only problems are catching up and accepting a zero grade on the first assignment.

It could take a while for the emulator to load everything and depending on your particular AVD, it could show a blank screen while trying to load. If the emulator has indeed stalled, you may want to free some memory before starting it again.

Thank you for your response, sir. Somehow got the HAXM thing resolved - using Version 21 which does not require hardware acceleration. Somehow I find Android Studio to be extremely slow on my Windows machine purchased way back in 2009, with 4 GB of RAM. Takes ages for the Gradle build. I'll start early for the next assignment; this was also my mistake in starting this assignment late. Wrong estimation on my side. Thanks once again.

Either way is fine. Android studio is just giving you the hint and helping you by filling in the stub code to get you started. If you directly type in the code the end result is the same.
55be4935a9a36e3ee10027aa
We do not have the flexibility to change deadlines as they have to be specified right at the beginning of the course (right when we first create the course in the system). I would suggest for you to submit your solution code to the TODO item even if you have not yet completely tested it. Much of the grade depends on the code. Only 1/5 of the grade is dependent on the test result (green bar). So you can get most of the credit even if you correctly complete the code and believe that it works correctly.

Let me start with the last problem.\nIf AS attempts to reinstall sdk and you are sure you already have it installed, then cancel it! By default, sdk is installed at C:\Users\"PC-Name"\AppData\Local\Android\nTo set the location, Go to\n\n 1. file\n 2. Project structure\n 3. On the left select sdk location and set it to where sdk was installed on your machine\n\nFor the first problem, there are two solutions. If your machine is running on an AMD processor then installing genymotion could be a possible solution but if you don't want to work with genymotion then make sure you download at least one of the ABI armeabi-v7 images from your sdk manager. While creating an AVD, make sure to create one with an ABI of armeabi-v7. Also peek here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching-\n\nIf however your machine runs on an intel processor and you're getting this error message, then take a look at this thread https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8

Actually, if you delete the .gradle directory it will be very difficult to re-create it. If you want to create a directory with "." in front of the name it will not work (Windows).\n\nI managed to create it using a batch file from gradle, but eventually I had to reinstall Android Studio to make the project import the right way.
55bef3b6a9a36e52940028cb
Sorry, we cannot extend the deadline because the entire course is structured to finish as per the specified deadlines announced at the beginning of the course. That's the reason we give students an extra week (the first week) to sort out Android studio issues and give one more week to finish the first assignment.
55be4164a9a36e7006002855
Yes indeed, there are at least three ways of specifying the onClick(). The reason I use the method shown in the exercises is that it is the most straightforward approach and makes the concept of listeners and event driven programming clear to the students. As an instructor, my job is to choose the most clear way of illustrating the concept. Having said that, you can use any of the other methods once you understand the concept well.

I think you can start "SDK manager" alone (Without the need of starting Android studio), the executable of the "SDK manager" is located in the "SDK" directory which usually is at C:\Users\UserNAme\AppData\Local\Android\sdk.  With the SDK manager started I think you can resume the update of the packages.
55bf252ca9a36e32370027d7
In fact you will have a total of 5 assignments, each of which carries the same amount of scores. You need to get 60% of the overall scores to get a "pass". For assignment 1, even if your Android studio is not working, if you manage to formulate the code without it, you will still be getting credits (see the rubric). Only the screenshot would require a fully functional Android studio and emulator and this part accounts for 1/5 of the total scores of assignment 1 which accounts for 1/5 of the total course scores.
55bf291fa9a36e7e5900280d
Sreesindhusruthi, if you are talking about the assignment, you need to add code yourself to make it display different messages.

It takes a while for the program to build and deploy to the AVD, I guess you need to wait for a while (several mins). You could check the pinned threads of this forum if later you discover there are in fact some issue with the AVD. It is likely that your problem has been solved in one of those threads.
55bf116da9a36e5e21002884
You may want to download/update "Android Support Repository" and "Android Support Library" in the "Extras" folder of the SDK manager.

It is usually because of the lack of free memory. I'd suggest you to run the system with minimal amount of software running before you start Android Studio.

Yes, it takes a while (at least several mins) for the application to be built and installed to the emulator. You may want to be a bit patient.

Seems to me that your AVD has not completely started yet. May be you want to wait for some more time before deploying the app to it. If the AVD stalls without being able to start, you may want to free some memory and restart the AVD again.
55bd076ca9a36e00ed00271e
I've solved this issue by chosing a lower resolution (320x480). The emulator screen would be nearly the half size. A collateral advantage is that the emulator seems to run quite faster. \n\n
55be76e6a9a36ea971002754
Maybe you need to update or install some libraries, go to the menu\nTools -> Android -> AVD Manager, and click the check in "Update" option, verify if there are some for API 21

Dear All,\nI sympathise with all the problems that you have faced. These issues with Android Studio and with your computers are beyond our control. Having said that it's the initial setup and weeding out the issues that takes the most time. That is the reason we gave you a week's headstart to get your environment ready for the course.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no other way around this problem. As Alex mentioned, once you get\nthe environment tamed, it's a smooth ride thereafter. Struggling through these problems builds a lot of character :-) You realise how much more you are capable of doing once you have been through all of this. Hang in there!\n

Add the code to display the appropriate greeting message. Your output message should be exactly the same as the one you see on the video with exactly the same number of spaces in the same positions.

You don't have to actually have the hardware acceleration and HAXM working to do the course, according to what they've said as long as we use API 21, we can choose a virtual machine that does not require it and uses less memory, e.g. `armeabi-v7a`, by:\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (e.g. does not require virtualization):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something) but you should now be able to run your code with this virtual device, without having to mess with hardware acceleration. \n\n\n

If you don't want to mess with your phone, you can still do the programs for the course by using either `API 21 armeabi-v7a instead of x86_64 or x86`, and/or choosing a smaller/slower device than the Nexus 5, for example the `API 21 Nexus One` is a lot smaller and needs fewer resources, so won't take nearly as long:\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (e.g. does not require virtualization):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n

55bc0f00b30d848ec40026be
Yes you can.  The else clause explicitly checks all other conditions not met in the if or else-if clauses.\n\nIf you left it off, the code would not check for the condition and no code would handle that time slot.   \n\nYes, you could have used an else if again, however, that is not common programming practice.

That is part of the problem.  Some peers believe that the else clause is not correct for that part of the assignment and they are deducting marks because of it.   Some of them don't understand decisions structures very well, apparently.\n\nThe confusion creeps in because the course indicates "explicit" checks and that is why some are confusing the else as non explicit, when it actually is.

@LGuaje, this message is because the x86_64 (and also the x86) emulators need the computer to have hardware acceleration in order to run, and that the emulator (HAXM) cannot run because it does not have that.\n\n**BUT never fear! You do not have to have hardware acceleration to do the homework**. \n\n**You just need to use the `armeabi-v7a` (instead of x86_64 or x86)** because it does not need hardware acceleration, and you can still run API 21 as required for the homeworks, by:\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- If you do not have `API 21 armeabi-v7a` then \n\n	* get into the Android Studio package configurator (same one we installed packages from; \n		* from Android Studio select `Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager`)\n		* find the entry for `API 21 armeabi-v7a`. \n			* If it says "installed" then you've already got it. \n			* If it does not say installed, then \n				* click the box to put a checkmark next to it\n				* click the button at the bottom of the page to start it (It may take a little time to download, but I think for just that it would be no more than 5 minutes? 20 at the worst? I am not sure, but it will make running the homework possible without hardware acceleration), and when it is done you can continue as below:\n\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (nor hardware acceleration):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n\n\n(You can look into whether your machine has hardware acceleration, and how to enable it later, but if you haven't yet turned in the homework my advice is to do work on the homework and not look into the hardware acceleration yet)

@Saad97, so cool that you are taking this at age only 17!\n\nIf I understand what LamAlex is saying about AVD settings, I think it is to change the configuration of the emulator device/phone that you use to run the programs. To do this, you would:\n\n- open Android Studio\n\n- From the row of images at the top, hover over the small rectangle toward the top right (in my screen it is grey, and it is the correct one if when you hover over it without clicking, it pops up a little message saying `AVD Manager`)\n\n- Once you have located this, click on it to open up the window showing your virtual devices (which may have one or more entries, or may be blank if there are none. Since you have already installed at least one device, yours will have a line showing something like "Nexus 5 API 21" or whichever device/phone you have installed)\n\n- At the right of the line showing your device are some icons; Click the middle one that looks like a pencil, to edit the settings for the device\n\n- This will pop up a screen with "AVD Name" at the top.\n\n- On the bottom half of the page there is a section called "Emulated performance", with a couple of checkboxes to the right of it\n\n- The top checkbox says "Use Host GPU" which apparently has to do with graphics performance\n\n- You want to uncheck that box, so that the device does *not* use the host GPU\n\n- Then, at the lower right of the page, click "finish"\n\n- This will leave you back on the page listing your virtual devices/phones. \n\n- You will have to wait a few minutes while it sets up the changes (You cannot tell by looking that it is busy. The only way I can tell when it is done making changes, is that I click the other device I have set up, since I have two of them. When the highlight bar finally moves to the other device, I know it is done)\n\n- I do not know a good way to tell when it is done, but once it is done implementing your changes, then you can close that window.\n\nI hope this helps. Post back if you have more questions, we are all here to help each other and *lots* of people are on the system and working on the homework tonight!

@AviAvinash007, I've been having problems playing the videos, too.\n\nSome things that can sometimes help:\n\n- closing extra programs in case they are taking up memory\n- clearing browser's cache\n- deleting cookies \n- logging in to edx again\n- closing browser and reopening it\n- trying different browser, if you have another installed (For me, I have Windows 7 Pro and Chrome always works best for me on edx)\n- rebooting entire computer\n- seeing if clicking the link to download the lecture will work, and watch it on your computer instead of online\n\nI think it is possible that the system is slow because so many people are online in our class today because of today/tomorrow's deadline? Although in my other courses, that issue made homework submission slower and sometimes hang, but it had not in my experience made any problems watching the course videos. Too bad the material isn't in the notes; then we could read them instead.\n

There is a way to do class assignments without hardware acceleration. You can use `API 21` or 22 as required by the course projects, but select \n`armeabi-v7a` (instead of x86 or x86_64 which require hardware acceleration and much more RAM), by:\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (and does not require virtualization):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n\nThen, when you run your simulation, select this device instead of the x86 or x86_64 one. Hope this helps.

@mar88, you can use smaller device simulators so you don't need hardware virtualization and it uses less space. It is slower but it works!\n\nIf your machine does not have hardware virtualization, you can use `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of x86 or x86_64 which take up more memory and more space), by:\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (e.g. does not require virtualization):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n\nThen when you run your program and it pops up the window for what device to use, choose this `API 21 armeabi-v7a` virtual machine to run it on.

@anotherlasse, that is a well-known issue in the edx peer review submission platform and applies to every course that uses it. I do not know whether edx has plans in the works to improve it or not. I agree, though, excellent platform for online courses.

I know that you can do the assignments using a smaller virtual device.\n\nMake sure to select `API 21` as required by the course projects, but **instead of using x86 or x86_64** which take up more room and require more RAM, use **armeabi-v7a**\n\n**Once you verified that you were able to use `API21 armeabi-v7a` and got it running**, this would allow you to go **into the software manager and remove the packages for x86 and x86_64 and free up some space**. You would get into it the same way we did to install the software, but you would put a checkmark next to every item marked as "installed" that you want to delete.\n\nThere are probably a bunch of extra things we can do without, but sadly for us the prof and staff have huge CPUs with lots of space and fast processors and huge monitors and unthinkingly toss off all these things we "need" that we actually don't and which a lot of us can't do. \n\nGood luck and keep posting if questions, we are all here to help each other!\n\n**Here's how to create a virtual machine using `API 21 armeabi-v7a`** (I would do this and make sure it works before deleting anything).\n\n- Get into the Android SDK \n- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (and would allow you to remove the x86_64 and X86 versions to free some space):\n	- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n	- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n	- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n	  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n	- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n	- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n	- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n	- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n	- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)\n

@jlvidals, if you can't do virtualization, you can still do the homework and the screencaps by using a lower-powered virtual machine:\n\nYou can still use `API 21` or 22 as required by the course projects, but select \n	`armeabi-v7a`, by:\n\n	- Get into the Android SDK \n	- Click on rectangle toward top right that says "AVD Manager" when you hover over it\n	- this pulls up a window with all your AVDs (or blank if none yet)\n	- To create a new `Nexus 5 API 21 that does NOT require as much memory` (e.g. does not require virtualization):\n		- Click green "+" that says "Create Virtual Device" at bottom left of screen\n		- this pulls up a window to select your hardware\n		- scroll to find "Nexus 5 4.95inches 1080x1920 xxhdpi" \n		  OR a smaller one like "Nexus One 3.7 inch 480x800 hdpi"\n		- click on it to select the one you have chosen\n		- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n		- Then, click to select `API 21 armeabi-v7a` (instead of picking the resource-intensive x86 or x86_64)\n		- Click "Next" at the lower right of the window\n		- If you want to also lower the memory allocations, you can click "Show Advanced Settings" button at lower-left, scroll down to "Memory and Storage" section and lower the settings for RAM and/or heap.\n		- Click Finish button at lower right when you are done\n		- It takes a few minutes to get this set up (in which it doesn't show that it is doing something)

@gmtaxas, As a last-ditch alternative, if it turns out that you do not have virtualization on your pc, then there is a smaller virtual device you can run; they're the ones named <br />`armeabi-v7a` <br />so this might enable you to choose API level 21 when you configure a virtual device, and be able to run the homework and demo programs and see/do what the professor does in class (albeit a little slower, but it's better than being stuck)

I actually reinstalled Android Studio (letting the SDKs still intact, it would've taken hours to reinstall them as well).\n\nThen after the reinstallation, the Gradle import works as expected. Something was messed up, maybe the version of Android Studio I had (installed quite some time ago) was not compatible with the files.

I have the same problem even though my screen resolution is 1280 x 1024, which is the best my screen can do, a nexus 5 is 1080 X 1920, so I had to do something else.\n\nMake a new virtual device by:\n1. Tools + Android + AVD Manager. \n2. Click the button Create Virtual Device...\n3. Pick one of the items listed \n4. Click Next\n5. The Drop-Down for Scale will allow you to change how many pixels of the virtual device go into one pixel on your screen. For example, if you pick 2dp on device = 1 px on screen, you get a virtual device that is twice as small in both length and height as the original.

Could you add some more RAM to your machine (does it still have unoccupied memory slots)? I think 4GB is okay, as I have been working on a 4GB machine for all the exercises/assignments of this course myself and I didn't encounter any serious problem. But adding more RAM will definitely make the learning experience more rewarding.

One thing to remember, even if your processor support HAXM, you can't use it inside VM. Moreover running Android Studio inside a VM will be painfully slow, even on the latest device.

I had the same problem. Then I noticed that after unzipping, the project file GreetFriend is inside an extra GreetFriend folder (this happens with Windows when you extract a zipped folder). I removed the extra folder and it worked. So check that your project is not inside multiple GreetFriend folders after unzipping.

Yes. You will not be able to do the class at all without at least 4.3. Because our grades rely on the automated test which rely on the Testing Support Lib which requires at least 4.3. So anyway, give up trying 2.2 or 2.3 phones.

I think you could create an AVD with ARM as the processor. You could refer to the link below:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b704dca9a36e529400226a
55be5d7aa9a36e86bc002772
I think the answer is positive. You could create an AVD for any device in the list.

**ikivar:** If you are a java programmer and know the right syntax to finish the first assignment you could always submit just the correct java code.  You can still get 4/5 points or 16% if the code is correct, for anyone who knows java this was an easy code assignment.  You would just be missing the final image for it to show that it passes the tests.\n\nAt least that way if you do happen to run out of time you can get some of the credit and then keep working to get it compiled.  No sense in having an 80% if you know what you are doing but just can't get the studio to behave.  The test part is only worth 4% overall so you could have the 96%.

The same, I made all steps described in the guide, however my peer tell me that not uploaded the screenshot, unfortunately my work with the emulator was in vain
55bdb47ca9a36e32370026ff
Another thought might be the original install.  Did you pay close attention to the error logs output by the install to ensure that no error happened?\n\nI had to reinstall HAXM because of an error in the initial install.\n\nIf none of the above is working can you provide your OS? Versions? RAM? and how much space is left on the drive?

This might help with the windows-1252 encoding issue:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/30012529/android-studio-1-2-project-encoding-mismatches-by-default\n\nI know this might sound a bit odd, but are you connected to the internet?  I wonder if the studio is trying to reach out to web resources as well and is having issues.\n\nAlso as LamAlex mentioned, could you go to the SDK area check the installed only box and let us see what you have installed like the image below that was shown earlier:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14385408523765506.png\n\nI believe you that all the content is installed, but on the tech support side it just helps us to concretely eliminate all of the factors.

It's not critical to have the ability to run HAXM, all it does is speed up the performance of the Android (x86) emulator. I think you should be able to use an Intel Atom x86 image without HAXM enabled, but HAXM will only work (and worth installing) for an x86 Intel based Android device in the emulator.

Believe it or not, I installed Android Studio et all on Mint then OSX then finally Win 10. I spent SO much time on it all as it wouldn't work properly and I was having issues with getting HAXM to work - mainly due to running Mint on a VM i.e. impossible!\n\nFinally, everything worked on Windows! Linux is the most confusing and complicated. I have not really used it very much before and thought it was about time but after so much headache and complex CLIs, I'll leave it to another time. It took me over a day to finally be able to get a stable enough installation and start the course. Don't give up! It's a learning experience for us all!

I only downloaded part of AP21 since that is what he said we would be working with. Also, only download one of the system images, such as the 'GApps Intel Atom x86' and none of the others as we are only working with a phone and not a TV, smartwatch etc. This will ensure a faster download and much less space taken up on your PC. In any case, I have just installed Genymotion and can delete all those installed packages now.\n\nIf we ever need to have the other AP's then you can just download them when needed.
55bb9bedb30d84b8bb002521
I forgot to add the snippet provided for calculating the hour (also inserting it earlier on), but since he gave it to us then he would expect us to use it. Besides, none of the marking criteria is based on this code so I think it doesn't matter if it was not included.\n\nFrom what I see, we only needed to provide the switch/case statement block in the TODO code submission and that's it.

Give up. \nYou will need at least 4.3 (api: 18). Because some of Testing Support Lib needs that (e.g., UIAutomator). To accomplish the assignments, the 1st choice is still the emulator. 
55bd991cb30d845692002678
Yes it's a lot of work :(.  To get it working in this iteration I had to:\n\n1. delete my code and add in their code\n2. remove the testing functionality from the code.\n3. restart the studio and emulator\n4. re-run the code to ensure it was uploading to the emulator\n5. add back the test case for the code.\n\nSo I will recommend creating a new project for each code you test. Use the download from the course to build each separately.  And then complete the steps to enable the testing on each.  It is a bit of work, but this just makes us better at testing a fellow coworkers project, a skill set that will be required in any development shop.

Hi, I already taken several Android courses as well. From what I experienced, all of these courses have similar problems, difficulty on setting the environments. This happens all the time so far, even some students who can't resolve the issue quits. Usually there will be many others that will help on the discussion forum. In my opinion, I think if someone want to learn Android programming, he/she need to be able to solve their own issue, at least comfortable to search online for solution and look at the documentations.\n\nAll of this difficulty on setting up the environment happened just because Android Studio is quite demanding on hardware requirements. If someone using device like Macbook Pro, maybe all of these problems wouldn't happened. But unfortunately most people don't use a very modern device, in fact the hardware and environment that we are using will vary greatly. This is the primary reason why we all have very different results. All of this hassle will turn to knowledge later.\n\nMoreover to understand the course, a bit of Java or other programming concept is needed. If not, we have to be comfortable to learn it at the same time (from tutorial or somewhere else). It will be hard to do this if we don't understand conditional statement or something like that. When I take my first Android course, I don't have knowledge about Java. I only have taken half of C# course and just started Java course part 1 from HKUST which is very useful.

Actually like Professor said, there are several ways to attach onClickListener. You can attach the listener to specific view needed, or you can even define the onclick callback method on the xml layout file for a specific view and create the method on the associated activity. No switch needed.

I think we do see the question.
55be4935a9a36e3ee10027aa
I would say that we did face similar issues when we just started and it did take us a while before we tamed everything on our machines (we did that on over 60 school machines). I guess since you have spent quite a bit of time solving various issues, if you have a machine with a reasonable amount of memory (~4GB), you will definitely be able to solve all the issues. Internet connect is also somewhat important, and we did encounter a number of issues in the middle of the downloading process so that we were forced to download the SDK for more than once. But then once Android studio is in place, you could start to play around with the various features on a real Android phone or an AVD through the Android studio and also the ADB. This has been full of fun!\n\nSo I would say, Android Studio is probably tough on everybody initially, but once you tamed it, it will start to show its sweetness. Please do not give up, because we are with you!
55be42d6b30d844457002843

I hope that your peers will understand your mistake and will not penalize your work. After all, the rubric says explicitly that \n\n> "Submitted code attempts to check for the time interval “At or after 6\n> am and before 12 noon” using appropriate Java conditional statement(s)"\n\n should be graded as Passed even if \n\n> "The statement does not need to be 100% correct in terms of the Java\n> language. It is acceptable as long as a check is present."\n\nIn my opinion, if you pasted in the conditional statement(s) to check the time intervals, you should be fine. Unfortunately 2 out of 3 of my peers did not think so.
55be16d9b30d8463fc002a8c
I got this response from a peer, \n\n"In normal conditions, everything should run fine with just an "else"... but the explicit check referenced above, (hour < 6 || hour >= 21), is missing in your code."\n\nIf all other cases are validate and else clause is still considered a part of the explicit check.  After the other cases, there are no more possible cases except that time frame that is left.\n\nIf you don't fully understand coding and the use of decision structures, then don't allow your ignorance to degrade someone's assignment.

The thread.sleep(50) command is setting up a delay before the test code calls the click event for the button.  For some, if the view doesn't load quickly enough on the emulator, the error is present.  The reason is that the button is not loaded yet when the test code runs.\n\nIf you are on a slower computer, or the emulator is using less memory and a bit slower in loading all the UI components, the error message is generated.  Putting in the sleep command and changing the value 50 to a higher number, provides an appropriate delay to compensate for slower loading emulators.

No, if you look at the grading rubric for assignment 1, the emulator only accounts for 1/5 of the scores. You can still get the remaining 4/5 of the scores even if you do not have a  working emulator, but we recommend you try to create a working emulator(or get a real android device if thi s is possible).

Still, it would've been nice to get things to run on my FROYO (2.2) smartphone.  Not gonna happen, at least not yet.  I installed the USB drivers, etc. on Windows Home Premium.  (It took surprisingly long to download from Windows Update, like 5-10 minutes total.)  I discovered I had to unplug the USB wire and re-plug it in, otherwise Windows (or something somewhere) got confused.  Then the program wouldn't download to the phone, which I think was because I did not have "accept from unknown sources" set.  Then I got the error that I was trying to run a later API in my old-API phone.  So I went into the Gradle file and made the 2.2 change.  I then got the following.  I give up for now.  BTW, I cannot get HAXM to work either -- the "improper signature" problem.  I spent hours trying to fix that, with multiple reboots.  Very aggravating.\n\n> Error:(9, 0) Gradle DSL method not found: 'minSdkVersion()' Possible\n> causes:<ul><li>The project 'TimeGreetFriend' may be using a version of\n> Gradle that does not contain the method. <a\n> href="openGradleSettings">Gradle settings</a></li><li>The build file\n> may be missing a Gradle plugin. <a href="apply.gradle.plugin">Apply\n> Gradle plugin</a></li>

what is your error message?

Perhaps you've unzipped it to a folder of the same name. You should have a folder which contains the project files directly in it not another folder of the same name.

1- The professor already has mentioned in one of the videos how you can bring forth the MainActivity.java and activity_main.xml tabs.  \n\n2- For rendering errors you have to check what rendering layout sdk are you using. Chances are you are using android M renderer. Download and use api 22 instead:  \n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14385247014429164.jpg

I was wondering what you meant, **JohnDoe9007**.  And now I realize it.  You are saying I could copy and paste the code I'm peer-reviewing into my version of the program, and see if it appears to run correctly.  Of course I'd have to run it through its paces.  I don't know -- for me it might be easier to visually inspect the code, since by then I basically know what I'm looking for.  Still, later in the course, when the TODOs are more complicated, it might be a real good idea to simply copy and paste.  Or a combination of the two might work, especially in the case of a coding style/approach I would not normally use.  Thanks for the suggestion!

This "api 22 requirement" problem is mentioned several times (me included) here in the discussion forum. The problem is even if you workaround the minimum api for this week, you're gonna need api 22 in later weeks because I saw one of the staff mentioned somewhere that the course gonna use some functionality which only exist in api 22 (or 21)     \nSee below for professor Muppala's (@jmuppala) answer on this issue:\n\n> I did not specify that you should use Nexus 5 API 21. That was the\n> configuration that we used as an example and the configuration on\n> which we tested our exercises. You can use a smaller phone like Nexus\n> One as long as you use API 21. Some of the features we illustrate\n> especially with material design are better illustrated only when you\n> use API 21 or above. Later on I show you how you can use compatibility\n> libraries to target lower APIs while being able to use some of the\n> newer features. It's just a matter of one more year by which time API\n> 21 and 22 will become more than 50% of devices. It's better to learn\n> the new features now and start building apps using the newer features.\n\n

A small note: I am currently going through the GreetFriend assignments using this method, and I have found a small problem: The project files downloaded from the course are all designed for APIs 21 or 22. Which basically means that if you want to run these projects on your device, you will need to have it updated to Lollipop. And as we saw in the very first lecture, Lollipop only accounts for about 12% of the currently running devices, meaning a whole lot of us will be left out in the cold if we want to run these project files on our devices.\n\nThe fix seems to be rather easy, though. First, make sure you have downloaded the SDK files for whatever Android you have on your device. Download the required files from the SDK manager.\n\nSecond, in the project, expand the "Gradle Scripts" tree and double click "build.gradle (Modules.app)". In the file, you will find a line that says "minSdkVersion 21". Replace 21 with whatever you like. In my case, I am testing against an HTC Desire which I have flashed with Cyanogenmod 10.1, which is Android 4.2, API 17. So I set minSdkVersion 17, and it works.\n

You need basic programming experience.

If you have created an id for the widget and then write code that references that widget the code would break unless it was updated.  So I believe android studio might be updating the references to that id in the code for you.\n\nThe XML file is where the id is stored.  Are you familiar with the XML format? (rather like HTML)\n\nThe text file that holds the XML definitions for the ID will also most likely update.\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14385026006196509.png

Well, I've managed to run the emulator properly.

I mean what kind of extraordinary features are we learning in an **introductory** android class. I guess most students are on Jellybean/Kitkat. It could have been much more fun if we could directly use our phones instead of the clunky emulator which has caused many problems for students (and this can be seen already in the course discussion forum).

shanen:  I am not sure what you mean by you couldn't work on your devices?  Doesn't android studio let you load up almost any system for testing and use the older SDK for compiling?\n\nYou could have just done the assignments in the latest version and then compiled them additionally on the older versions.  It would have tested your capability to develop on multi platforms.\n\nIf you ask for help here in the forum, there are many qualified people that should be able to help you get the studio up and running for your devices...  \n

Could you download the zip file again, unzip it into a directory and load it as an existing project?
55bdb47ca9a36e32370026ff
You may want to use the SDK manager to update/download "Android Support Repository" and "Android Support Library" in the "Extras" folder.\n
55bdb7d2a9a36e5e210027b8
Yes, it does, you could use the project window to navigate to the code.
55bdb920a9a36e1b220027ed
I think you may want to  free some memory for Android Studio.

Humm perhaps reducing the memory footprint might help?\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55bc70abb30d843e9600259d\n\nDirect link: http://techzog.com/development/android-studio-high-ram-usage/\n\nI know that the startup of the emulator's Virtual Machine (its a VM that is running linux + android OS ) took forever on my machine to initially load.  I am not sure but it seems like the real deal OS so I was connected to the internet while it was loading.  I also had to increase the memory for the Nexus 5 as I have a MAC and run HAXM.  I was getting error messages at the bottom of Andriod studio while the simulator was configuring.  It feels like a real cell phone where it has to reboot several times as things get loaded.  **The emulator also is using up 1GB+** of hard drive space on my computer.\n\nI would look for any odd messages in Andriod studio at the bottom area to see if its not indicating that there are problems loading.\n\nI was able to allocate more memory to HAXM (if you have this installed) by reinstalling it from this link https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/ its got 2GB right now.
55bcebeca9a36edf340026c8

**ubiquitus:** When I installed it from this link it asked me how much ram to allocate. https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/   \n\nSo I initially installed the android studio on the **MAC**. The HAXM part failed due to the VT-x setting.  Then I fixed the VT-x setting so I could actually install HAXM.  Then I downloaded the HAXM from that link and at that point I was given the choice from 512MB - 2GB.

I think if you read the error, it is self explanatory. ERROR: Could not initialize OpenglES emulation, use '-gpu off' to disable it.\n\nThis problem occurs because your system's graphics driver is not up to date or it does not support the actions required by the emulator.\n\nYou could either \n1. update the graphics driver, then reboot the machine and then start AVD again.\n2. edit your AVD settings and un-check "Use GPU".\n

Did you set up the path for SDK in Android studio? You could refer to the following article for setting up the SDK path:\nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio
55bd4a61b30d84569200264f
Did you actually manage to save the file? This course does require prior programming experience and in fact we list JAVA as the language you should have learned.

You could refer to our materials in week 0, SDK is essential for the Android studio to work.

May be you want to delete the debug.keystore file. Its default storage location is in C:\Users\userName\.android\ on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
55bd7c3ca9a36e362d002722
Not completely sure about your problem (emulator showing the hint text, and the user input gets into the place of the hint?), but I believe a good way to solve this problem is to go back to the steps that you dragged the EditText and check the course video very carefully  step by step for the corresponding part to see if you have done something wrong there.
55bda5f7b30d84bdd200271d
The assignment does not involve any video. You may want to check your code (download and import the zip file again if it is a fresh project you have just started).

> installed JVM and added JAVA_HOME varaible C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51\bin But still same error\n\n@adityalsr, I had the *exact same* situation -- and although you would expect that it would want the exact directory with the executables, it does not want the bin directory that has them, **it actually wants the directory above the bin directory (which in your case is)**: <br /> \n> **C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51**\n\nSo all you have to do is follow the almost-identical procedure, but select **edit** and then erase the "bin" part, and save your results (or just overwrite `JAVA_HOME`'s entire path with `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_51`), and this problem will be solved.

This is because the AVD is still trying to load, so you are seeing the "Android" word. The loading process could take up to 10s of minutes. If the AVD does not start correctly, try to free some memory as the AVD takes quite a bit of memory (1GB or even more).

I did not specify that you should use Nexus 5 API 21. That was the configuration that we used as an example and the configuration on which we tested our exercises. You can use a smaller phone like Nexus One as long as you use API 21. Some of the features we illustrate especially with material design are better illustrated only when you use API 21 or above. Later on I show you how you can use compatibility libraries to target lower APIs while being able to use some of the newer features. It's just a matter of one more year by which time API 21 and 22 will become more than 50% of devices. It's better to learn the new features now and start building apps using the newer features.\n

Thanks, that worked for the view. Then I got the HAXM problem. First it was not installed, then after download I couldn't find the file (hidden by Windows). After installation, the memory was set too low for the emulator. It runs now but the emulator is large and takes over the left side of the screen (I saw a post for this). It seems that the biggest challenge so far is getting the programs to run. 
55bcf442a9a36ea971002695

Same problem here. I used a Nexus 4 with 512 MB of RAM . After clicking on Run, a nexus phone emulator shows up with a black screen then after a while, the text "android" is shown. I waited a few minutes (~10 min) but nothing happens(lock screen doesn't come up).   \nI'm on a Win7/64bit on core i7 with 4G of RAM.  \nOne last point: I think the emulator tries to copy sth on my drive since I could see its being filled. I wonder why this happens?

Joquen, you need to wait for a while for the project to be loaded completely. This could take mins or even 10-20 mins on a slow machine.\n\nIf you are sure that the project has been loaded completely. You could click on the vertical word "project" at left hand side of the Android studio interface. The project window will appear and you could navigate the project using this window.

SyedZubeen:  \n\nComputer OS? Version? RAM? Free space left on HDD?\n\nIf you are running on a MAC did HAXM install correctly?
55bce9abb30d847d27002676
**Aleks_Romanov:**\n\nTo get a better understanding where you are at in the install process, what is your OS?Version? RAM? Free HDD space?\n\n1. Android studio downloaded and installed ok initially? (were there any errors?)\n2. Installing the SDK content according to the image given in the course worked ok?\n3. Having finished the SDK install did you restart android studio?
55bcf442a9a36ea971002695
**Techman98:** \n\n*Computer OS? Version? RAM? HDD free Space?*\n\nAndriod studio is a pig on resources.  I have 16GB RAM so my computer is fine but I had to allocate 2GB to the HAXM install so the Nexus 5 would run nice, it wanted at least 1500MB from me initially.  And the Nexus 5 emulator VM file size seems like another 1 GB.\n\nI had to also enable an emulation setting before HAXM would run on my MAC.  Did you have any problems installing initially?\n\nI grabbed the HAXM from here:\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager/\n\nAnd followed the instructions from the link below to enable the VM functionality for my mac by turning on the VT-x setting.  (It sometimes is in the BIOS)\n\nhttp://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html\n\n(section: Configuring Virtual Machine Acceleration)

what if you download the zip file and unzip all the files into a directory before importing the project ?
55bd076ca9a36e00ed00271e
Agree with Alex. Further you can do the followings on Command prompt or Terminal: \n\n1. telnet localhost "ID of AVD"\n2. window scale "value"\n\nThen it will become small or big based on scaled value.

Which emulator are you using, name, screen size etc?\n\nThe Nexus 5 on my computer is running 1080x1920.  If your computers actual screen resolution is low the emulator might be displaying off the screen?  Perhaps try using a different emulation with a smaller screen size?
55bd076ca9a36e00ed00271e
I guess your PC screen resolution is probably too low, could you switch it to have a higher resolution or alternatively could you create an AVD with a smaller screen resolution?

I am assuming that you are importing the existing project TimeGreetFriend. I think you were not able to download the total package. \n\nFurther, if you are trying to create a new project, so you have no instance and it would not cause any problem if you have installed everything properly.

I also so this in one answer. However I didn't give the point in that one, because the instructions said:\n\nSubmitted code attempts to check for the time interval “At or after 9 pm and before 6 am” using appropriate Java conditional statement(s). The statement does not need to be 100% correct in terms of the Java language. It is acceptable as long as a check is present.\n\nFrom what I understand we do not have to be too strict in it being correct Java, but it says there should be the appropriate statements, which it didn't...

I don't have this issue, but from what I have read here, it seems that you can still continue if you instead use an ARM based system image instead of the Intel ones. Besides,  HAXM is a hardware accelerator for the Intel chip and your system has an AMD one, so it would do you no good. \n\nIf I'm wrong here, please correct me.

Hi, glad that you sorted out the problem. Thread.sleep(50) will delay the code for 50ms.\n\nI already taken several Android courses as well. From what I experienced, all of these courses will have similar problems, difficulty on setting the environments. This happens all the times so far, even some students who can't resolve the issue quits. Of course there will be others that will help on the discussion forum. But in my opinion, i think if someone want to learn Android programming, at least he/she have to be able to solve your own issue, at least comfortable to search online for solution and look at the documentation yourself.\n\nAll of this difficulty on setting up the environment happened just because Android Studio is quite demanding on hardware requirements. If someone using device like Macbook Pro, most likely all of these problems wouldn't happened. But unfortunately most won't use that, in fact the hardware and environment that we are using will vary greatly. This is the primary reason why we all have very different results.\n\nMoreover to understand the course, a bit of Java or other programming concept is needed. If not, we have to be comfortable to learn it at the same time (from tutorial or somewhere else). It will be hard to do this if we don't understand conditional statement or something like that. When I take my first Android course, I don't have knowledge about Java. I only have taken half of C# course and just started Java course part 1 from HKUST which in fact very useful.

I think you were trying to give the relative layout an empty name in the statement 'android:id="@+id/">' (the string after the '@+id/' identifier at the right is treated as the id/name of the corresponding object, which is the relative layout in this case). I think you could solve the problem by simply removing the identifier '@+id/' (i.e. the red part) but remember not to not remove the ">" symbol.

Thank you very much for your reply. I supposed too a trouble with the fast speed of the AVD on my PC but I didn't know the method to slow it.\nI tryed the Thread.sleep(50) and all is fine now. A recent discussion about that give more details about that.\nSorry for my long text before and thank you for people who debug the test. By experience, another platform or university with online courses don't matter if you have a trouble with the Android SDK bugs: they just reply to you that probably you have a malicious software instead of trying to use their brain ! I passed different certifications with EDX, and sure that the best platform I found. Android is a young product and I know it's really difficult for a university to build a course with a very fast growing product. A potential source of frustration is probably the use of Nexus 5 AVD on an AMD processor! Can we use it on an AMD processor ? Not sure!  In other words, does AVD need Intel processor ? Not all one has a recent Android device. \nFor information, I ran the test (with sleep method)  and all is fine with the AVD Nexus 5 vith API 21 on  Intel platform. I just test it too with the API 22 and Is working fine too.

Thank you for your answer LamAlex. Problem is, even through my processor supports VT-x, my BIOS doesn't have the option to enable it (It shows only as "supported", with no "enabled/disabled" option. There is also no "Hyper-V" on my windows features). I've tried both AVD and GenyMotion with no success and couldn't find a solution on the pinned posts nor on general forums. My android device is a Motorola G 2015 with Android 5.0.2, So I believe it matches the minimal requirements for this curse. I was only concerned if there are any negative impacts (on the device) for using it.

55bb858ba9a36ea5840025db
When you create the virtual device, select those virtual device with ABI column having the strings "arm64-vXX", or "armeabi-vXX". In that way you will create a virtual device based on the ARM processor -which does not require HAXM.
55bb8a53a9a36ea5840025df
Seems to me this could be a network problem. You may want to talk to your Internet service provider regarding that.
55bb8d0eb30d843c41002638
If you have an AMD CPU or an intel CPU that does not support VT or you have not enabled VT in your bios, you will not be able to install HAXM. But do not worry because you can always create a virtual machine based on the ARM processor (i.e. select those virtual device with ABI column having the strings "arm64-vXX", or "armeabi-vXX").

May be you could do "Build"->"clean project"  and then "File"->"invalidate caches/restart...". In the worse case this does not work, make back up of the code you have typed. Close the project, delete it and import the zip project file again. Copy the code to the corresponding Java file and save it.\n\nPlease be minded that 'Cannot resolve R' can occur at the beginning of starting the Android studio when it is still loading, and this loading stage could take minutes or even 10-20 minutes on a slow machine.

Olamhen, Android Studio could be slow, from your description I suspect that your computer was still working hard to load greetfriend (could be in the order of minutes or even 10-20 mins depending on your hardware configuration). Make sure you allocate as much free memory as possible before you start Android studio, when memory is not enough you could have a really bad responsiveness from the Android Studio.

If you want to be able to run your apps on the AVDs, and if you want to do automated testing, you will need at least API 18,21,22, and "Android Support Repository", "Android Support Library" from the "Extras" folder of the SDK manager.\n

Found out what was causing troubles.\nI wasn't running emulator and when I was running tests, third test failed.\nWith emulator up and running everything is as it should be.\nThanks for help.
55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
Thanks for pointing that, you're right. But when I type that code (Thread.sleep(500)), Android Studio throws an error and suggested 2 solutions... The one I used was:\n\n        try {\n            Thread.sleep(500);\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n\nThanks again!

Even if HAXM is installed it requires user manullay running it from extras folder in sdk path.\nSecondly VT- is not enabled in my machine, so it is not working for me.\n\nLet me try from my BIOS to enable and will try again. Till then will disable hardware acceleration.
55bb4591a9a36edd160025bd
Package manager is apk installer on the android. It looks like your emulator isn't able to completely boot up. Maybe you want to try to use Genymotion instead, refer to the pinned thread on how to install it properly.
55bb3f68a9a36e362d002614
Need to see the error, you already have API 22.
55ba6719a9a36e362d002595
It seems like your emulator haven't boot up completely.
55bb5149b30d848f100028a6
Please elaborate your doubt
55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
Find the '//TODO' in the Java code and put your code there. Some instructions have been provided as comments. You need to modify only the MainActivity Java, and nothing else.\n\n*Note: You are going to need at least basic Java Programming knowledge for this course most probably. You can catch up by reading basic stuff on websites like www.tutorialspoint.com, or just ask here.*
55bb4591a9a36edd160025bd
In my case it does! and many times! I've tried rebooting, starting the emulator and then building HelloWorld project (the other way around too).I don't have cpu capability to HAXM, so arm is my choice right? I've tried all arm's flavors of lollipop , and the one that seems to do anything interesting was the one with API 21 and google APIs,here the emulator undergo into some kind of app updating then cancelled itself. Seriously , do I have any chance to survive this course?\nThanks LamAlex! Right now I'm recharging all SDK packages. Won't quit yet!
55bb3f68a9a36e362d002614
i will download API 18 and i already have 21 and 22. thank you
55bb4591a9a36edd160025bd
I think it shouldn't cancel,  what if you do a reboot and try again? I have never seen the emulator kills itself.
55bb3f68a9a36e362d002614
jaideepsinghchauhan, I would suggest you to at least download API 18, 21, 22, and also "android support repository" and "android support library" in the "Extras" folder of the SDK manager to avoid problems now and in the future.
55bb4591a9a36edd160025bd
Thanks for answering! I have tried everything. My laptop hasr a 8Gb RAM,even so I killed all apps before running the emulator. My emulator cancels after a short while! could this be a security issue?
55bb4591a9a36edd160025bd
I think the phrase "package manager" is referring to the software module that manages the application packages on the Android device. So basically this message is telling you that your Android virtual device was not responding. I think you might wish to wait a bit longer until it has fully started before running the code on it. If it does not start, you may want to kill some applications to free some usable memory for the virtual device.

 To swipe the screen, you need to press the left mouse button while pointing the cursor to the AVD screen, move the cursor (with the left button pressed throughout the duration) from one end to the other end will mimic a "swipe" action on the AVD. If you just see the Android Logo, chances are that the AVD has not been started successfully, you may want to kill some applications to release a bit more memory before attempting to restart it again.
55bb10bbb30d8477000025ac
Did you move the onClick() method to another place? It should be within the View.OnClickListener class.
55bb2dddb30d8454c7002448
I am assuming that you are working on a Windows machine: (for mac, you may refer to reply 71 in the following link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching- avd)\nMake sure you have enabled Hardware Virtualization in the Bios Make sure you have downloaded Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). You can do so by opening thr SDK Manager and Download Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). Which I believe you have already done. After that go to the directory (C:\users\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras > intel > Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and double click to run the file "intelhaxm-android.exe". Follow the instructions to finish installation. Restart Android Studio and then start AVD again.

there is another way,by opening projects and then right clicking in the one you want to deleete. there is a delete option there (a little  bit hidden ha?).

It seems that after we have uploaded an image, if we click the save button and refresh the page, the image will disappear. Due to platform limitation, it is difficult to test whether the image is actually retained by the save action. So I believe the safest way is to re-upload the image before the final submission.
55bafdeab30d84bdd20025b6
Hi, it is on TODO section. The code will run when a click event to the button received, because it is on the onClick method.

55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
Your code will only do unnecessary loop, taking some memory, and loading up your CPU to 100% for a short time. If you want to use some delay, just replace that code to Thread.sleep(500); // 500ms delay

 1. I think that will be OK. To do that you need to change build.gradle\n    on the app module. Open that file and change minSdkVersion to 19.\n 2. I never use that OS, but I think you should be able to take\n    screenshot\n        by pressing PrtSc (print screen) on keyboard and paste on any image\n        editor, or use the built in snipping tool.
55ba4e2ab30d84bdd200250d
Don't worry about the error log you mentioned, most of them happened in the memory of the emulator. I usually just close the emulator window, which sometimes crashed it :D
55ba3b24a9a36e5a76002524
@chwin, it is not required, but depending to your hardware, it can take a very long time from 2 minutes - 2 hours (which doesn't make any sense). In that case, maybe you want to try other solutions.
55ba2934a9a36ecf41002519
Android text showing up means phone is booting up. This can be long if no HAXM support. After that it should show lock screen that you can slide (with mouse) to unlock. If the wait is too long, you might better to use Genymotion if you want, there is a tutorial how to do it in the other thread.

If its version is too old, there could be some features we are using that are not being supported. You may wish to see all the pinned articles, it is likely that your problem with AVD could be solved.

Did you modify the test part? It should be looking for "Good Night John!" instead of "Good Night John!". Could you download the zip file again and fill the TODO part with the code you added?
55bad5d3a9a36e1d46002554
1. As far as I know, you need to have API 18,21,22, as we are using some specific features from these layers. If your AVD does not start normally, chances are you were out of usable memory, try killing some applications to free the memory.\n2. I think you could still choose an AVD with API 21, but have a smaller screen resolution, usually it will take less memory.
55bad3c8a9a36e7e590025b7
Could you switch back to "intellij" ?
55bace66b30d846a86002525
I think you may want to wait for some time, it could take minutes for Android studio to finish loading everything, before that it could issue error messages which will be cleared once it has finished loading.

Thanks, Wellsen. It worked for me on a real device (Moto E) after moving the button up, not being covered by the soft keyboard. Another way of making this to work was delaying the execution of the test with a code like \n\n     for(int i=1;i<=5000000;i++)\n        {\n            float a = (float) Math.sqrt(i);\n        }\n\nin the MainActivityTest.java, between the  perform typetext John and onclick button code - maybe you have to adjust the loop to meet your hardware speed. This way, we need not to worry about the layout pieces.  \n\nI am running Android Studio on an AMD Desktop and, on Windows, Haxm is not supported, so no virtual devices on this side. \n\nI tried it on Ubuntu 15, that accepts Virtual Devices on AMD and I had the same problem. So delaying the execution of the code or moving up the button made things happen!
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
Is there a workaround for AMD?  I have a AMD processor - C60 Dual core processor.\nIt runs Virtual box and VMWare player just fine.  \n\nBut I am getting this HAXM error and can not see m to get it resolved.

avd mgr asking for haxm\n\nI have AMD C60 Processor and running Windows 7.  How can I resolve this issue?
55ba4e2ab30d84bdd200250d
Ok, thanks for confirming that it's normal. I'm the tech guy at work and when people just hit the power button my the machines it can destroy hard drives and corrupt the file system. Just didn't want that happening here.
55b7f92db30d843e96002219
I have the same trouble. I'm using the Nexus AVD API 21.\n
55ba8e06b30d84bdd200255c
Thanks for figuring that out. Which virtual device did you create from the choices in Genymotion?
55ba8e06b30d84bdd200255c
My pleasure
55ba814eb30d8482e6002460
seems to me that the AVD has crashed (correct me if I am wrong). Could you download the latest version of HAXM driver in the sdk manager and have it installed?  You can do so by opening thr SDK Manager and Download Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). Which I believe you have already done. After that go to the directory (C:\users\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras > intel > Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and double click to run the file "intelhaxm-android.exe". Follow the instructions to finish installation. Restart Android Studio and then start AVD again.\n\nBTW are you running the code on a Core2 Duo cpu?
55ba791da9a36e5a76002557
Is your AVD in the locked mode when you were running the test?
55ba8e06b30d84bdd200255c
thanks for your input on enabling the choice of the Android device for the test.
55b97985a9a36e315a0023ea
Hi, it's just because the reference to the button used in more than 1 method. If the button is only used on 1 method, you can always define it locally.

Most likely the emulator can't boot up completely. Maybe you want to try Genymotion emulator if can't use HAXM.
55ba2934a9a36ecf41002519
Hi, you said that you choose API 22, but the the one on the log is Nexus One API 21, is that the same emulator? Is the emulator have been completely boot up?
55ba69a5b30d848f10002803
Well OK, thanks for the link. But in the future, if additional zip files are to be used, you should add the link to them above or below the video embed.\n\nI can't believe nobody else mentioned this. How did everybody do without the zip file?\n\nEDIT: Oh, the link was provided AFTER the video. Fine.
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
This problem appeared to me too. I turned on Intel virtualization technology in BIOS but despite of this after I ran the installation of HAXM I got the following message:\n![enter image description here][1]\n\nSDK manager tells me that HAXM installer is installed without any troubles.\nI also tried to do what JesusIsLord advised but there's no "Hyper-V" option in "Turn Windows feature on/off" for me.\nCould anyone help to handle this?

Are you using a real device? If so see the post about unable to run on real device and asks instructor for fix. Basically a delay of 50ns needed to be added before nextClick is called from the MainActivityTest.java file.\n
55b97985a9a36e315a0023ea
Thanks but I was wondering why only the Button is global and the other Views are declared locally.  Why wasn't the Button declared locally or the other Views declared globally.

This happens to me too. When it does that, point it to the location of the sdk, the default location is usually in AppData

Are u getting any errors?
55ba4e2ab30d84bdd200250d
If you go to the "Android" console view at the bottom of the screen, you can click on that, and when the view comes up you can click on the red "close" button in the left hand margin and close each process until all the process have stopped. That's about a minute worth of clicking.\n\nI usually go to "Run" at the top of the screen and stop the program, then I either go to "Android" and close the process or just close the emulator's window. The stack trace goes crazy with errors when I close the window like you did, but that normal. It won't affect your code.
55b704dca9a36e529400226a
I also have an AMD processor.\nEver since I found that error I have been trying to find a fix....\nI installed the extras and all the 5.

Hi there hkust-victor! I did what you said. Still the same problem: not seeing the lock screen in the emulator (though this time some of the cellphone buttons seems to be expecting a click, nothing happens when I do it).

Yes, you need to download sdk tools. 32-bit windows shouldn't be the culprit of the problem, I guess you may want to check the amount of usable memory and close as many other unused applications as possible, Android studio itself needs 2GB of RAM to be working. 
55ba3b24a9a36e5a76002524
Hi guys, same problem here!\n\nI have tried several cellphone emulators. My las one being Nexus One API 21,500 Mb in RAM.Not showing lock screen.

Either your AVD has not started up properly or it is the locked mode. If it is in the locked mode, simply touch the screen of the AVD (using cursor) and swipe to unlock it.
55ba6501a9a36ecf41002559
Make sure you have downloaded the "Android Support Repository" and "Android Support Library" in the "Extras" folder from the SDK manager.

Write whatever sensible comments that you wish your peer know. If you feel you do not have any comment, I think you could leave it blank.
55ba3b24a9a36e5a76002524
Could you create another AVD with a smaller screen, try closing other applications in windows before starting the AVD (allocate at least 1-2GB for it if possible).
55ba2061b30d840995002567
I was facing the same issue. What I did is create a small resolution screen with API level 19. \nAlso in build.gradle changed the versions to below and was able to run the test: \n\n    defaultConfig {\n        applicationId "hk.ust.cse.comp107x.timegreetfriend"\n        minSdkVersion 18\n        targetSdkVersion 18\n        versionCode 1\n        versionName "1.0"\n        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"\n    }\n

I also have AMD, i have to wait long to get the lock screen on the stock AVD created in studio. \nI am using Genymotion which is very fast. \n\nYou can try the Genymotion virtual device instead of the stock AVD from Studio. \nYou need to install \n1. Oracle Virtual Box\n2. Genymotion software and create an avd in genymotion\n3. In Android studio you need to install genymotion to connect to the genymotion virtual devic.

55ba2061b30d840995002567
Ofuochi, could you create another Android 5.1.1 AVD with a smaller screen, then when you do the test you will be able to select this new device (which will utilize less memory). Alternatively you could close other applications to release memory for the AVD. \nDon't worry, even if you do not manage to start AVD and to provide the green bar, you should still be able to pass the course without any problem because for assignment 1, the green bar accounts for 1/5 of the scores, and you only need 60% overall to get a "pass".

Hi Inge_k,\n\nIf your CPU does not support virtualisation technologies, then the emulator cannot use virtual machine acceleration. But you can still start the emulator without using hardware acceleration.

My processor is Athlon X3, slowest and older than FX series.\n\nOther thing you can do is to try to update the Bois if there are a newest version. Is a critical process, do it with care.

Both of them are treated as references.\n\nThe difference is, the button is declared global within class MainActivity and its reference is determined (separately) later when the view is loaded. Whereas the textMessage is local within method onCLick and its reference is determined within the same declaration.\n\nI think the short hand syntax of textMessage confuses you. It's 2 statements combined into 1: Declare, then assign.\n\n===================================\nButton greetButton;\n\n// get a reference to the greetButton on the UI\ngreetButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.greetButton);\n\n// get a reference to the TextView on the UI\nTextView textMessage = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textMessage);\n===================================\n

I think you accidently specified the UI element of the design view. It's an object, not a plain text string. What you see is the entire object, not only the text content of it. To manipulate the text content of the UI element you need to call a method.\n\nFor example:\n\n1. To make a reference to UI element textMessage:\nTextView textMessage = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.textMessage);\n\n2. To set its text content:\ntextMessage.setText("Whatever the text string here. Such as good Morning John!"); \n

Sir, now SDK manager is giving new error that is \n\n"Downloading Google USB Driver, revision 11\nDownload interrupted: Unknown Host dl.google.com"\n\nWhat should i do?
55b9fbe3b30d847c6f002478
I have done this myself. In my desperation, I closed down the project by clicking: "File", then "Close project". This is a menu path at the top left corner of the screen. When you close a project Android Studio will show a screen to say nothing is opened.\n\nThen you launch Android Studio again. Now under "Quick Start" you will click "Open an existing Android Studio project". Next, you drill down to the folder that keeps your project and doubleclick on it, it will be loaded into Android Studio. On the left panel, you should see the folders within the project. At this stage, our assignment involves only 2 folders: "Java", and "Res". \n\nI think last time you accidentally clicked on a wrong folder that opened something completely scary. Hopefully you did not save the project in the messed up state.\n\nWatching the video clips carefully will guide you exactly what components of the project to work on. I was like you yesterday and today I seem to know what to do.\n\nGood luck !!!!\n\n\n

@bmiillller, I checked from the submission record but could not see any image uploaded. Did you see your screenshot from your submission? If you can see the uploaded image from your side, I will write to edX to investigate your case. However, regardless the investigation result, we just have no power to modify any grades with this platform. But there will be more graders showing up to grade you assignment and if they can see your image, the grade might be rectified.
55b9fa43b30d843e9600240c
Hi jack1990,\n\nI suppose you're talking about Assignment 1. As you run the test, the test will see whether your program is correct by checking the text in the TextView and the expected text. An error message will prompt if it doesn't match or the test is said to fail. In your case, it seems like the TextView is still "Good Afternoon John!" while the expected one is "Good Day John!". Please make sure that your programming logic is correct. Otherwise you'll not get a green bar (a successful test result) for the assignment.
55b86c6bb30d848f1000266e
Hi,\n\nI had the same problem as you. I could solve the problem making several changes:\n\n - I use AVD: Nexus 5 API 21 CPU x86 Resolution 1080 x 1920)\n\n - Open your phone emulator and access to “Settings”, you should change the “Security” in order to the phone doesn't lock the screen.\n\n - Access to Settings --> Display and set a long time to Sleep (ex: 30 min.).\n\n - As suggested our mate **jopZ**, you should put your widgets (greetButton and editFriendName) to the top half of the screen.\n\nI hope it helps you too!
55b9f8b4a9a36ecf410024f7
Hi santosh_aero,\n\nThe error message is quite self-explained. As you're using a 32-bit operating system and the support to it is limited, the emulator therefore cannot start correctly. Please set the environment variable "ANDROID_EMULATOR_FORCE_32BIT" as true so that when the emulator starts, it is forced into a 32-bit option.

Hi,\n\nA lot of people have encountered similar problems. The problem can be quite different across different devices, so this is why we strongly encourage you to use Android Virtual Device for development and running tests.\n\nIn case you really need to use a real device, please make sure you turned on debugging mode in developer options. Make sure you choose the right device which the app should be running on.\n\nAs you didn't give so much information, I can only suggest the above as a checklist. Please give us details about the problem.
55b9ebd0b30d84c9b80025d5
Hi Sreesindhusruthi,\n\nIt seems like a lot of people encountered this problem. Please make sure you installed every single required package as mentioned in the Courseware page. If you confirm you've installed but it still doesn't work, you may try installing HAXM from [https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager][1]. Or you may disable hardware acceleration in your emulator. Please also have a look at the configuration of emulator [here][2].\n\n\n  [1]: https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager\n  [2]: http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html

I did steps 1-4. After clicking button "Upload your image", the uploaded image is displayed exactly like your sample screen of step 4. \n\nNow I want to click button "Save your progress" but it is disabled. I do not want to submit my work now because I feel it is still imperfect but I cannot proceed with saving. So I exit the webpage.\n\nI reboot my labtop and go back to the same place to check on my assignment progress. Now I see only the "TO DO" Java source code is still there.

Hi MickPat,\n\nThe error tag "INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK" means that your device's API level cannot agree with the minSdkVersion of your Android app. Please make sure your device has an API level greater then the minSdkVersion.

Hi prateekkonduru,\n\nIt seems like your emulator did not start correctly. You may try tuning the configurations of the AVD you use. You may also try using an AVD with lower memory requirement and with lower screen resolution. If possible, you may also need to adjust and use higher screen resolution for your operating system.
55b9a0d8a9a36e7006002588
Hi srikanth_gurram,\n\nYou may have a look at this [link][1]. This problem might be caused by the AVD when it tries to render graphics. Please make sure you installed everything needed, as instructed in the CourseWare page, in the Android SDK Manager. You may then update your graphic card driver. Set a higher resolution. You may also want to disable the setting "Use Host GPU" in the Virtual Device Configuration in the AVD manager.\n\n![enter image description here][2]\n\n\n  [1]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30686324/error-while-running-android-application-could-not-initialize-opengles-emulatio\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438234139298331.png

Hi vargaslen,\n\nPlease make sure your emulator is up and running before you compile and run the app. Furthermore, please also manually unlock your device's screen lock. Security measures may prevent you from accessing the debugger before the screen lock is unlocked.
55b704dca9a36e529400226a
Yeah following the steps in the course you can fix the situation of knowing if you installed correctly and install the tools as well.. https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/72365fc2f807409582f1db38f3ac6879/34766342bdd7458a9baa266d184e27f8/1\n\nBut I have another issue since that every time (evereday) that I open Android Studio I have to reintall it because the program ask me to do that, I don´t know it is right and how can I chane this... and i don´t see anymore when open the program once reinstalled how to get back to the welcoming program (welcome to Android Studio) when I could review I have installed right HAXM..\n\n

I ABSOLUTELY submitted a screenshot, but according to my feedback, only 1 person of 3 saw it.  If one person saw it, then I think that's proof that I did upload it.  I believe there is a bug on the peer review side where some browsers are not displaying the image.\n\nIf it matters, I uploaded a PNG file with a .PNG extension.  I'm running Windows 8 (yeah, Win8 is embarrassing, but I also have a Linux box), and the "snipping" program defaults to capture.PNG. Perhaps the all caps PNG is not recognized by some OS/browsers.

The test requires that the device or emulator should be at least API 18 or above. Otherwise it will not work as expected. That is the reason we suggested to use the emulator.

Try downloading and running Genymotion anyway. I now have Genymotion working as my emulator within Android. At least for the "Hello World" project but not yet for the "Greeting Project".

It will be better if you could put your code in the same function as the //TODO comment, instead of creating another function. Because that will be easier for your peers to assess your assignment and minimize the potential danger of not getting the deserved credit because of misunderstandings.
55b91c19b30d84c9b800252c
Gman2XS, he/she is indeed doing the check, though the statement has misuse the logical operator.  Since he/she did attempt to check the condition (between 21:00 and 6:00), so he/she should have the 100% credit according to the criteria.
55b91c19b30d84c9b800252c
But what about a submission that has the condition:\n\nhour >= 21 && hour < 6\n\nwhich is a logical impossibility? 
55b91c19b30d84c9b800252c
It says that it doesn't need to be 100% correct, so I would say full credit.

vargaslen, you don't really need HAXM, lack of HAXM support only prevents you from using x86 or x86_64 virtual machines. but there are always the ARM based virtual machines. If the virtual machine is not showing anything after tens of minutes of wait, chances are, it can not get enough memory to start, you may want to close some of the applications to free up usable memory.
55b8dc24b30d84b96a0022b5
Could you provide more details. If the AVD does not start, and nothing is shown except for a dark screen, you may want to kill some other windows applications to allocate enough memory for the AVD.

Hi,\n\nIt doesn't really a big problem, but let's say somewhere in the future you want to add some text in the program that says only "Good Day!". You might ended up creating 2 strings and / or need extra work to modify string.xml. In comparison if you only put the text without space, you will only need to adjust the Java code whenever addition is needed, and adjust it using something like this:\n\n>     textview1.setText(getString(R.string.good_day_string)+\n              " "+friendName+"!");\n>     textview2.setText(getString(R.string.good_day_string)+"!");\n\nThank you.\n

You don't really need HAXM to work with this course. As far as I know, lack of HAXM support would only prevent you from using a x86 or x86_64 based Android virtual device, but you still have a list of ARM based virtual device to select from.

Hi Akhilarra,\n\nAlthough we are not advised to give you direct answers, I can tell you that if you are willing to go through the lectures and exercise, you'll know how to complete assignment 1 very quickly. Actually, in assignment 1, you don't have to write too much code. So even if you may not be familiar with the syntax of Java, you can still complete it.

Hi Animats,\n\nThe project can be download from ***Courseware -> Week 1 -> Exercise: Greet Friend(Part 1)***. Please make sure you don't skip lectures. The project files are actually quite easy to locate if you go through the lectures and exercise.
55b8ac72a9a36e7006002487
Hi all,\n\nIt seems that this problem is more or less related to network problem. There are several reasons why the required file cannot be downloaded. Please make sure you have internet connection and can access **jcenter.bintray.com** from your computer without restrictions. In case you can access other URL address but not **jcenter.bintray.com**, this means **jcenter.bintray.com** is temporarily out of service or your internet service provider has blocked connections to this host. Then, what you need is a proxy / VPN service. You may connect to a VPN via openvpn.net or other providers. **Please make sure that using VPN is a legal activity in your own country, and you may use it at your own risk.**

***@wellsen***  \nI disagree. You create the values that go into the `strings.xml`, so why wouldn't you make the space a part of that string? My string values got created automatically by AS and it included the space because it was part my greeting message, so is AS wrong?\n\nIf you look at the [textual instructions][1], second item in step 2, they have the following code:\n\n> `textMessage.setText("Good Day "+friendName+"!");`\n\nAs you can see it's part of the original string, why separate it?\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/234fa80753b1476592ae17d37b17bb9e/598b666a30cc4d72840b00682ee8ceb4/

My computer has the same issue of not supporting Virtualization. After I try to run the intelhax-exe file, the error message appears "This computer does not support Intel Virtualization Technology (VTx). HAMX cannot be installed." Even before I enrolled in the Introduction Android class, my computer kept giving me the same error over and over again for almost 2 months and it has 4GB of RAM. I had already downloaded Android Studio because of my interest in learning App Development. I also checked my BIOS, but my computer doesn't have the option to enable Virtualization. \n\nAfter troubleshooting my computer and taking it to Microcenter (a computer store) to have Tech Support to look at the computer, I found out that my Windows 8 laptop has never supported intel Virtualization. I was hoping that by taking this class, that a classmate or the instructor can give me another alternative, but it looks like, I will have to purchase a new computer soon that supports Virtualization. I am very eager and excited about learning how to develop apps using Android, but it looks like my computer may hinder me from fully participating in this class.

Hi Erlis,\n\nAs our course only requires you to use Android Virtual Device, you basically don't need a phone/tablet to test. In case you really want to do this, you can compile and run the app in your device. But please make sure you set the minSdkVersion to match the Android version in your device. As you proceed with the course, I suggest using Android Virtual Device instead of real devices so that unnecessary problems can be avoided.

Hi DiaaHesham7,\n\nOur course will mainly use the Android Virtual Device as our testing platform so you basically don't have to get a real device. But if you really want to try it using real devices, you may have a look at the following:\n\nFirst you have to make sure your turned on "Developer mode" in your device. Then you connect your phone to your computer via USB connection. Also make sure you installed proper driver(s) for your device, in case you are using Microsoft Windows. Next, you compile and run the project in Android Studio. In Android Studio, you can choose which device you're going to run the app. Please refer to the screenshot below:\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/1438163392877579.png\n\nFinally, you'll see you app running in your device. \n\nPlease also make sure your device's Android version is higher than the minSdkVersion of you app.

On windows 7, this can be fixed by configuring the BIOS.\nIn order to do this you need to restart your computer. When it starts coming up you need to hold down a key that will interrupt restart and will bring up the hardware setup menu (BIOS).\nThis key is usually F1, but could also be Esc or some other key. Usually there is a remark on the logo screen (the first screen to come up when you restart) that says something like "Click [key] to enter setup".\nwhen the setup menu comes up (usually an ugly blue screen), you need to find the option to enable VT-x. I found it on the "Security tab" , but it can also appear on the CPU tab.\nwhen you find the option, change it to "Enabled" and then "Save & Exit".\nThis worked for me. Hope it does for you too.

I had to modify the test by inserting a Thread.sleep(100) between hiding the softkeyboard and clicking the button.  \nThe test was clicking the button before it was visible, which caused a security exception.\n\nMoving the text field + button to the top half of the screen will probably work as well, as the keyboard won't overlap the button.

But for me that has not fixed it, so i have to go even further, later on ill  temporarily disable anti-virus and hyper v, to see if that works hopefully...

ok im guessing ur working with a windows 8.1??? well if u do then go to settings/change pc settings/update and recovery/recovery/advanced settings(restart)/somewhere in change tools or something you will be able to find /change uefi settings(restart again)/you will now be in the bios, use the arrow keys to move an enter to ..enter, go to f10 to change system settings/system configuration/and enable virtual technology...hopeflly that helped :3

This is a really honorable decision! \nMy respects to HKUST!\n\nThere are course providers where I've the impression that they publish a course for the sake of having published without taking this kind of care.\nThanks for being different!
55b8586ca9a36e315a0022d8
Sorry you should not publish the code anywhere. The code itself is copyrighted by HKUST. We provide it for the course, not for public release.

In this exercise, the switch is not really needed because we have only one button.\nTherefore it *seems* that there's no big difference in where to declare the variables.\n\nNow imagine if we had a second button (or more), then we had also a second switch case (or more).\nIf you declare your variables inside the switch case, you would have to declare them in all switch cases. This would be really bad practice: redundant declarations would blow up the code.

Hi, if you are using Nexus 5, you might want to try lower resolution device like Galaxy Nexus instead.\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276\n

If you are using Nexus 5, try to change to a lower resolution AVD:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
Additional hint:\n\n1. If you can't make emulator to work and decided to use a real device, you can do it for this assignment. Change minSdkVersion on build.gradle file on the app module according to your device API. Be advised this is only temporary solution. When we learn material design later you will need device with API 21, whether it is emulator or real device.\n2. I saw that some people got PerformException from the test. After a bit searching, It seems a known bug happened to some (not all) setup because of the emulator is too slow and the click to the button is blocked by the soft keyboard, before it getting closed. My advice is first try with lower resolution device. I personally use Galaxy Nexus with 768 MB RAM. My laptop is an old 2nd gen i3 with 8 GB of memory. Nexus 5 is too slow for me. But I can live with Galaxy Nexus :D If it can't help, you can try to move the button up a bit. That should do the trick.
55b85813a9a36edd16002349
Hi,\n\nFor this assignment I think there will be no problem, you can change minSdkVersion from your build.gradle file on app module to match to your device. But when we learn material design later, we will need at least device with API 21, whether it is real device or an emulator.
55b853f0b30d847700002341
Hi, I think what you mean by "widget" should be shown if you open the layout xml file and switch to design mode.
55b8467ca9a36ee25a00232e
Emulator shows a blank screen usually means it is very slow and can take hours to start. It seems like you don't have enough memory. My recommendation for your system is to use real device instead.\n\nLike the name said, Google API image is the image that already put in some Google API on the emulator image file. So when you build app using eg. Google Map API later, you don't have to install anything more to your emulator.\n
55b7dbf8b30d84bdd2002276
My thoughts about **AVD vs Genymotion**:\n\nIf you just install the free version of genymotion, it's rather limited.\n([compare versions of genymotion][1])\n\nI don't know exactly what we will be learning in this course, but I think it could be useful if we're able to simulate a phone call or to do some testing on network performance. This can easily be done in AVD - or in the payed version of GM.\n\nConcerning the speed (or should I say slowness?):\n\nUsually, I start the emulator when I start Android Studio, and I don't shut it down, just kill the app inside the emulator at the end of the test run. Therefore, I don't feel much difference between the AVD and GM - the great difference is in the time that's needed to launch them. \n\nMy personal conclusion: Even if genymotion has its advantages at first view, it's worth to stick with AVD.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  [1]: https://www.genymotion.com/#!/store

Hi, In my opinion they both their own trade offs:\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b089e4b30d846a86001e34

add more memory
55b7de54b30d8468500023a1
make sure you have turned on virtual machine on bios on, andthat there is enough space(RAM) for the emulator to work, reduce the resolution size, and use a lower api, hopefully that helps :)
55b7dc98a9a36e7006002385
It looks like you haven't turn on the AVD, or the AVD isn't detected. The box is blank.
55b812f4b30d840f2c002482
try running something simple as this and play around with it lol.  \npublic class Hi{\npublic static void main(String[]args){\nsystem.out.println("Hello World");\n}\n}\n and if you want practice (codingbat) is a good place to start,coding is best done by practice not reading, but the reading should help you to though. 
55b86c6bb30d848f1000266e
Did you create your AVD exactly as in the instructions in the lectures? This type of error can be caused by an API level mismatch. 
55b7d0d9b30d846850002389
Hmm, it seems some kind of reported bug that happened on Nexus 5, the soft keyboard is blocking the click to the button because it is too slow to disappear. Maybe you want to try with lower resolution device. I usually use Galaxy Nexus instead.\n

I did it slightly differently. I downloaded the zip file into the folder that stores the HelloWorld project. In there, I unzipped it to get the actual files in a new folder called TimeGreetFriend. All this was done outside of Android Studio.\n\nThen when I went back to Android Studio, it still had project HelloWorld opened. I followed menu path File->Close project. Everything in ANdroid Studio is now blank. But in the left panel you will see 2 projects are available for open. You can click on TimeGreetFriend, it will launch the setup of the project in Android Studio.

that would make sense also, since there no need to read the values before that you know what you should do. But, I guess they wrote it in that way to the TODO were specific code on the assigment instead of all the code.

It would help if you posted your PC's specifications, it's cpu, memory, gpu, etc...\n\nNow onto your questions:\n\n1. The target in the Nexus 5 API 21 should be "Android 5.0.1" and in the default "Google APIs" so everything is good there. The black screen I cannot explain, sorry.\n\n2. Click the emulator window and then click ALT+Spacebar, this will show a little menu, from there choose the "move" option with your keypad, hit enter and the move it down a bit. (can confirm it works)\n\n3. In the official docs it says: ["To stop an emulator instance, just close the emulator's window."][1] So I guess that's the only way.\n\n4. We would need your PC's specifications for this one. One solution though, is to pick a phone with a lower resolution as stated [here][2] (They recommend the "Nexus One, 3.7", 480x800, hdpi")\n\n\nI hope this has helped in some way even though I couldn't really answer the first question.\n  [1]: http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html\n  [2]: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/234fa80753b1476592ae17d37b17bb9e/fc389104d6c5416ca171bedd00a089a1/

According to this website: https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78646\n\nThe problem may reside in your CPU not being compatible with the HAXM driver when emulating a 64 bit system image.\n\nThis response in particular is the most helpful: \n\n> I did the uninstall and reinstall, same issue.  But I looked at the\n> Release Notes and saw this so maybe my PC can not support HAXM?\n> \n> known Issues: \n> -HAXM driver does not support emulating a 64 bit system image on Intel systems based on Core microarchitecture (Core, Core2 Duo etc.). All\n> systems based on Nehalem and beyond are supported. (Corei3, Core i5\n> and Core i7 machines).\n\nWhat CPU do you have? \n\n(Anyone reading this, I don't have a solution that doesn't involve using a different computer, so if you know one please leave a comment)\n

Increasingly cross-platform apps are becoming common in many cases where you don't need all the functionality of the native platform. Having said that, there are some cases where there is no other option when you need some native functionality (increasingly getting blurred). Performance is still an issue with cross-platform apps. We've done many projects with Cordova/Ionic. In case you have interest in cross-platform, ask me directly.

Yes, this indeed helps. Thank you.

If your PC has sufficient RAM (e.g. 6G or above), you may create a AVD using CPU "armeabi-v7a" instead of "x86_64" to avoid the HAXM error.

So far as I can see, HAXM will only run on Intel processors of a reasonably recent vintage.  You need to enable virtualization in the BIOS, and also make sure the HAXM software is installed and running.  Googling the error messages will provide some links to help pages on Intel's site.\n\nThe key thing I missed, that held me up for several hours, is that when you "install" the software via the Android Studio SDK manager, you are in fact only downloading the software and not actually installing it.  On Windows, you the need to open a command terminal window in administrator mode (right-click on the "Command Prompt" icon and select "Run As Administrator"), then change to the ~sdk/extras/intel/Hardware_Accelerated_Manager directory, and then run "silent_install.bat".  In my case, from a normal Android Studio install, the sdk directory was under C:\Users\<my name>\AppData\Local\Android directory.\n\nAs administrator, you can run "sc query intelhaxm" to see if the thing is running properly - you should see a line saying "STATE: 4 RUNNING".\n\nSince I'm new to this, it's not clear to me whether the ability to run HAXM is critical to completing the course exercises, but it does seem to be a requirement for using an AVD that has x86 in its name.\n
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
Are you on an intel PC? HAXM does not work on AMD.\n

Hi,\n\nDon't change the test files. It defeats the purpose of the test. You should put the exclamation mark on your code instead of the test file.\n
55b7b400a9a36e315a0021f7
Didn't work. I did it the same way.

I don't think this is a good solution. Just add the space programmatically.\n

Hi, when you start the emulator for the first time, it will create temporary file. On my computer it is around 1GB. That is normal.

Hi,\n\nAndroid kills activities which are running in the background when there is a need for memory. If an activity is paused or stopped, the system can drop the activity from memory by either asking it to finish, or simply killing its process.\n\nAnyway, how did you "retrieve the picture and send to your app". You can get the thumbnail from the camera from the resulting extra of the camera intent. But you must get the actual image from the storage. Saving image to memory is an easy way to exhaust it.\n\nThank you.\n
55b78634a9a36e4e4e0021da
Hi,\n\nYeah, it is possible. After it is downloaded, just copy the "Android/sdk" folder and set the project properties to that location.\n\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b3a578b30d844457002031

I have the same problem. I have Android Studio installed on my laptop computer (Fujitsu Siemens Amilo PI2686 running Windows 7 64-bit). There is no setting in BIOS about virtualization technology. Can I use my smartphone (Android JellyBean) for this course instead of the emulator or is there anything that I am missing?

Hi, sorry, just got back after 1 day away. To resize the actual AVD window, you will need to use Telnet command. But for your problem, it seems that only the title that unreachable, you can auto-hide the windows taskbar first or do this trick:\n\n1. Click the emulator window.\n2. Press Alt-Spacebar.\n3. The menu will appear, press down once and Enter (Move mode).\n4. Move the emulator window using keypad arrow on the keyboard.\n\nI hope this helps. Thank you.

It runs slow, but using linux (ubuntu mate) at least, it works. I installed Oracle Java version 8 and android studio

This was answered below:\n\nI am assuming that you are working on a Windows machine: (for mac, you may refer to reply 71 in the following link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching- avd)\nMake sure you have enabled Hardware Virtualization in the Bios Make sure you have downloaded Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). You can do so by opening thr SDK Manager and Download Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). Which I believe you have already done. After that go to the directory (C:\users\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras > intel > Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and double click to run the file "intelhaxm-android.exe". Follow the instructions to finish installation. Restart Android Studio and then start AVD again.

You can see from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_version_history\nthat version 4.2.2 is API 17, so if you are able to build your apps using any API less than or equal to 17 they will run OK on your device.\n\nHowever, we are asked to install only API's 18 - 22. :( \n\nSolution: For now, install API 17, using the SDK manager in Android studio.  If you find that you cannot support the assignments with API 17 then consider using an AVD (android virtual device). Alternatively,  upgrade your phone's OS, or get another phone.\n\nGood luck!

Meanwhile, I did all 5 assessments - and there is a screenshot (if any submitted).\n\nBut I noticed that the comment field for the afternoon section is missing.\n\nAnother remark: I think it might be useful to make it more clear HOW to submit, e.g. only hit the submit-button after having pasted the code and after having uploaded the screenshot. (One of the other submissions was just a copy of a single paragraph of the instruction - I can't imagine that this was intended!)

Hi guiprx,\n\nI am not sure which exercise you are talking about. But for the tag "RelativeLayout", we usually don't need to specify the id, unless you want to map/refer to it in the code. So in this case, you can remove " android:id="@+id/" ". It should still work properly. Or you may feel free to put any id you want, as long as you don't have any conflict in id's with other UI components.
55b77c82a9a36e66e80021a9
remove that line except for the > sign. The id is not needed for the RelativeLayout

If a screenshot is absent, your peer will lose that part of the score. Because of the restriction imposed by Edx, He/She will not be able to re-submit, so I guess he/she will not be able to rectify. But this course requires 60% of the score to get a pass, so it is likely that he/she will be okay (as far as I know, this is a pass/fail course, correct me if I am wrong)..

very sorry to bother u again.\n\ni managed to start the installation of haxm. and while it was installing, it said\n\n"this computer meets the requirements . bla bla but VT -X should be turned on. "\n\nthen it pointed me to intel haxm documentation. somehow this link is not opening.\n\ncan u tell me how to turn on VT -x?\n\nthanks again
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
go to sdk manager on android studio, go thru the packages there you find extras in that haxm should be installed. while installing haxm will ask for the ram (1024 mb) remember this ram amount then finish the haxm installation . go to adv manager go to any phone in that advance settings change the memory to 1024 mb this memory should be similar to haxm installation memory.\n

ok.. pls disregard the last msg. i was able to install the haxm. then i closed android studio and started again.\n\nthe sdk mgr shows haxm as installed.\n\nwhen i ran the avd mgr i get the following error:\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14380808831158552.png
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
i dont understand ur response.\n\nhowever i did go to sdk and installed the extras .... in which the last option ws the haxm.\n\nand everything got installed EXCEPT the haxm!!!!!\n\nhelppppppppp
55b75255b30d8454c700209f
for 1. you need to have haxm installed properly. refer to the  thread below for the steps\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/discussion/forum/course/threads/55b3ec61b30d8463fc002247\n\nfor 2. it appears to me that you are unable to allocate enough memory to the AVD, try to edit it and set up a smaller memory requirement for it. Closing other application(s) will also help. If you wish to watch videos and work with Android studio + emulator together, you need 8GB of memory to be productive. If you are only working with Android studio and emulator, you need 4GB of memory to be productive.\n\nfor 3. I believe it is because your AVD was unable to get enough memory allocated, so it is not accepting connection request from adb.
55b74b67a9a36e70060022cd
Seems to me that you didn't download all the require packages. Could you try to download " Android Support Repository" in the "extras" from the sdk manager? Make sure you have also downloaded API 22,21,18. If possible I would recommend to download everything suggested https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/72365fc2f807409582f1db38f3ac6879/34766342bdd7458a9baa266d184e27f8/\n\nso that you will not see weird problems. 
55b749a7a9a36ea5840021d8
I am assuming that you are working on a Windows machine: (for mac, you may refer to reply 71 in the following link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching-\navd)\n\nMake sure you have enabled Hardware Virtualization in the Bios\nMake sure you have downloaded Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). You can do so by opening thr SDK Manager and Download Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM installer). Which I believe you have already done.\nAfter that go to the directory (C:\users\\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras > intel > Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and double click to run the file "intelhaxm-android.exe". Follow the instructions to finish installation.\nRestart Android Studio and then start AVD again.
55b746f7b30d841bfd002244
Please refer to the link below:\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/72365fc2f807409582f1db38f3ac6879/34766342bdd7458a9baa266d184e27f8/\n\nYou will need at least "Tools", API22, API21, API18, download also the "extras", in particular "Android Support Repository" and "Android Support Library". 
55b7462bb30d848ec4002263
You need to install JDK, JRE is not enough, \nplease refer to step 3 or the following link\nhttps://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/72365fc2f807409582f1db38f3ac6879/34766342bdd7458a9baa266d184e27f8/\n\nand then you need to set up the environment variable according to text box "To set up Android Studio on Windows" the link below \nhttp://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio

HI Dhanunjaykumar. I HAD THE SAME ISSUE. HERE'S THE WAY I SOLVED IT.\n\n1. Open android studio\n2. Click on the AVD manager icon\n3. On your virtual devices windows, edit the virtual device by clicking on the edit icon under the action tab\n4. In the AVD window, click on change on the operating system (mine is lollipop)\n5. In the system img window, click on the api level tab. By default mine is on lollipop(x86) ![sys img][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14380742945181503.png\n\n6. Download lollipop(armeabi-v7a) just below lollipop(x86)\n7. After completion of download and installation, try run your virtual device again.\n\nI hope this solves the issue. GOOD LUCK!
55b7462bb30d848ec4002263
Check whether you have java installed JRE and JVM and are available in the path variables.

Thanks Vahenr. I am now at a stage where Android studio can "see" Genymotion. That annoying HAXM error persists though. I thought that by using Genymotion that that particular error would disappear?
55b6fd01a9a36ed5820021c7
Thanks Victor. I reluctantly went down the Genymotion path as I was unable\nto find any mention of Virtual Technology or VT-x in my UEFI. At least I am now at the stage where Android Studio can "see" Genymotion.

Hi,\n\nIn your Gradle file change the minSdkVersion to 14, remember we are using IceCream which very old.\n\n\n\n
55b71efca9a36e70060022ab
Hi FearNandoReynab567,\n\nThe error message Failure [INSTALL_FAILED_OLDER_SDK] usually means that you're installing an Android app with a higher minSdkVersion than the device's API level. Please make sure your device has higher API version than the minimum one as required by the app.

After you have submitted your assignment, you will be supplied 5 peers' assignments. You will have access to their code and you can give them points based on the rubric provided.
55b701dba9a36e4e4e00216e
Hi StarkXIII,\n\nThis course requires you to do assignments on a weekly basis. It is advised that you submit the assignment before the deadline set by the course instructor. First of all, you may refer to https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1/courseware/72365fc2f807409582f1db38f3ac6879/34766342bdd7458a9baa266d184e27f8/ to set up your coding environment. The setup and the first assignment are easy, and you may complete them within one to two days.
55b7120ca9a36e7291002304
Hi Shiwangb,\n\nDid you use the latest SDK Manager? If you use an old version, this kind of problems may occur. According to this link: http://androiddiscuss.com/1-android-discuss/85675.html, the language of your operating system may also cause this problem. If you can't fix it, please try using English as the system-wide language of your operating system and restart the computer. It should fix the problem.
55b6fd01a9a36ed5820021c7
Hi MickPat,\n\nYou can use this steps (I am using Linux but it has to be the same steps)\n\nDownload genymotion first then:\n\nFile > Settings >Plugins and click Browse Repositories.\nRight-click on Genymotion and click Download and install.

Hi Dhanunjaykumar,\n\nFirst of all, you need to make sure you installed Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator, as in the picture shown below:\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://courses.edx.org/asset-v1:HKUSTx+COMP107x+2016_T1+type@asset+block/l1-4.png\n\nYou may check by starting the Android SDK Manager to see if its status is "Installed".\n\nSomeone has encountered the same problem. Please also refer to the link here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26355645/error-in-launching-avd\n\nFurthermore, on Android Developer official page, they have already mentioned how to configure. Please refer to http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/devices/emulator.html#vm-windows

55b675d0a9a36e00ed00213e
I agree with the philosophy and learned most of my languages the same way, but I have to say that Android Studio has been quite unpleasant to work with so far... The default configuration was overwhelming for my target machine, and when I tried to trim it down, there were lots of "interesting" dependencies to resolve. Then after climbing those walls, the performance was excruciatingly painful and slow... \n\nFor instructional purposes, this tools does not feel ready, but maybe I'll give it a second shot on one of my larger and newer machines... That or drop the course per the OP.

55b6fd01a9a36ed5820021c7
Hi MickPat,\n\nYou may try and follow step by step in this link: http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2013/11/22/android-studio-plus-genymotion-emulator/\n\nThough Genymotion is good, I still want to recommend using the original android emulator for your benefit, because the course instructor is using it in the course. We'd better stick to what he suggested doing, so that we can avoid some kind of problems.

Hi Vlad_Mx, \nFor the Java problem you encountered, you may follow this link(http://javarevisited.blogspot.hk/2013/02/how-to-install-jdk-7-on-windows-8-java-32bit-64.html) to install JDK in Windows 8. \n\nAnd in Android Studio, you may assign different working directories when you create different projects, which means your projects can be located in different path.
55b5d532b30d847c6f002037
Thanks!
55b6f128b30d840995002201
Hi,\n\nI guess you're using a 32-bit operating system and this is why you may need a 32-bit version of Android Studio. If you're using Microsoft Windows, kindly refer to this link: https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/android-studio-for-32-bit-windows-operating-system\n\nYou may start the 32-bit version of Android Studio by clicking studio.exe instead.

Hi abuakram,\n\nThere are two ways for you to download the sdk. \n\nFirst of all, you may try as what ofuochi has suggested (using a proxy). There are many proxy lists you may choose from. In this case, you may visit http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other to download manually in browser. The setup is also straightforward.\n\nSecondly, you may also try VPN. Please make sure it is legal to use VPN service in your country before you attempt. Onn of the famous VPN providers is vpngate.net. You may try this one as well.\n\n

I could be wrong, but apparently the editing window supports only a subset of of the html features. For Latex, apparently you just need to enclose the latex code by a pair of dollar signs (i.e. you could have $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ by enclosing \frac{1}{2\pi} with a pair of dollar signs).\n\n\n\n

Two Doubts:\n\n1.- At the time that I tried install Java, I got a message tht says that Java doesn't work on Windows 8 / 8.1 so that it would be installed in desktop mode". I think that it means I wouldn't havet nothing in screen (interactivity includes), so How this thing could affect to me in the course? (and How to solve it (change the operating system is not an option)\n\n2.- I didn't find in AS any option to choose the working directory for the course (last two paragraphs of the "Installing Android studio (second page)" so I only will créate it in my Harddisk.

hi Mick\n\nI strongly recommend you that try to acces to your BIOS to check if your machine allows hardware acceleration... [HA does not depends of your OS ]\n\nrestart your computer and press repeatedly a key "del" before your OS is loaded [ depend of your pc ], "F8", "F2", ""insert,.... and check if HA is available.\n\n\n![enter image description here][1]\n\n*How to enter the BIOS or CMOS setup*\n\n\n\n* http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000192.htm\n* http://www.pcworld.com/article/241032/how_to_enter_your_pcs_bios.html\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14380098379281754.jpg

Can anyone who has already downloaded those suggested essential packages inform me, how large will the file size be? Am planning to download it from another work station outside my office.\nThanks

If we download this, how does it provide IDE same as android studio or is this an alternative for Adroid stuido.
55b1e656b30d844457001fa3
So, if in the above case, what would be the alternative.\nActually I used it before and uninstalled it couple of months back.

They are installed for boosting performance. They can't be installed on linux because they are designed for Mac and Windows. It will be oky with linux. It will work fine.

You could "edit" the emulator and decrease its memory to 256MB, which should be enough for our exercises/assignments. Alternatively you could close some windows to allocate more free memory. Typically the emulator would have problem to start when it does not manage to get enough memory.
55b40429b30d8463fc00224f
Hi,\n\n[1] Depending what is your habit, but for me, since I usually only work at home which I will always be online, I prefer to use online documentation whenever needed, so I didn't install documentation for all API.\n\n[2] If you don't have problem with HAXM, it should be Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image, I haven't compare 32bit and 64bit version, so not really sure which is faster/better.\n\n[3] If you target higher API, you can use very nice features of that API like material design (API 21), etc. A nice explanation can be found on this 4+ years old question on StackOverflow, but it still applies until now, look at 2nd answer:\n\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4568267/android-min-sdk-version-vs-target-sdk-version][4]\n\nIn the past, I used to force to create app that is compatible as low as API 8 (Froyo) because of the hope for reaching as many target as possible. But often times it lead to difficulties and limitations in coding, like try-with-resources which requires API 19 or headache for implementing some UI Layout for lower API.\n\n\n  [4]: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4568267/android-min-sdk-version-vs-target-sdk-version

Thank you for your prompt reply, and I should apologize for not being clear enough that disk space is the problem on this oldish SSD machine.\n\nThough I also have an oldish degree in CS, I haven't done much with Java, so working with it is one of my goals for the course. However, I did recently enjoy a Python course, and would also have enjoyed continuing on that path. 
55b4a82ea9a36ea584001fdb
This is exactly the reason for the first week having no specific tasks. We know that Android studio issues need to be weeded out by the students on their machines before they begin the actual work on the exercises and assignments.
55b1e656b30d844457001fa3
I was also facing the same problem. There is a bug in Android studio IDE you can solve this problem by downloading some other version of Android studio IDE or as it is developed by IntelliJ IDEA you can download IntelliJ IDE Community edition for free from \n[here][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/\nIt will work.
55b4d7feb30d848ec4002078
Please stop complaining. They are doing you a favor by allowing you to take this course for free. Other Courses in this Edx Platform are very expensive (at least for my pocket).

Try it after restart if restart does not work then reconfigure emulator with difrent setting.

Little confusing in that the start date of the course seemed to be the 21st, but now it appears that nothing actually happens until the 28th (apart from my ongoing struggles to get the Android Studio ready).
55b40429b30d8463fc00224f
When I took the defaults, it installed as around 20 GB which created some major stress on my target machine. It would help if the installation instructions would be clear about the smallest set of packages that we really need, but I can't really apologize for the limitations of my hardware...\n\nAnyway, for now I only installed Android 4.4.2 (APT 19) because that appears to be the version in my smartphone. However, I actually think I should have installed something lower if I am hoping to write something that will work in both my phone and tablet, since the tablet has an older version of 4... It still seems likely that I'm going to have problems, at least from the wording of the installation instructions.\n\nP.S. Even figuring out how to control the installed files using "Android SDK Manager" was far from "intuitively obvious to the most casual observer". First I had to figure out how to delete the packages I obviously didn't want...
55ae1213a9a36e362d001cf8
Well it depends all OOP languages look similar(structural or syntax wise) but it depends if you know how to apply them in the right way then yeah,but any previous experience can be considered helpful,nor would you find java all to difficult, so GoodLuck!

I installed API 18, 21, and 22 SDK without documentation. Usually we can browse through documentation online whenever needed. The contents is the same. For system image, I only install emulator image for API 22. When I need to test some app to lower API device, I just need to install that particular API image later and create another emulator based from it.

I have an AMD machine and Genymotion is working fine for me and is faster than Android Studio AVD.

@shanen: Don't worry about having installed extra packages - the only downside is that you may not have sufficient hard drive space (unlikely these days). In any case, you can remove them with the SDK manager if you need to.\n\nJava is fundamental to Android development, unless you want to go "native" and use C++ and the NDK (which are not covered by this course). If you are new to Java, make sure you understand the concepts of scope, visibility, the differences between a class and an interface, anonymous inner classes, generics, threads and callbacks. Of course there's much more, but these things are common in Android programs.\n\nIf you get stuck, Oracle's Java tutorials, the Android developers website, stackoverflow and Vogella are lifesavers.

I think you are confusing Apple's IOS 8 and Mac OS X. \n\nFrom the Android website at https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html:\n\nYou need:\n\n- Mac® OS X 10.8.5 or higher, up to 10.9 (Mavericks) [I am running Yosemite 10.10.3 with no problems]\n- 2 GB RAM minimum, 4 GB RAM recommended\n- 400 MB hard disk space\n- At least 1 GB for Android SDK, emulator system images, and caches\n1280 x 800 minimum screen resolution\n-Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 6 [Forget JRE 6, use JDK 7]\n-Java Development Kit (JDK) 7 [Keep it simple - use JDK 7 only - works fine]\n- Optional for accelerated emulator: Intel® processor with support for Intel® VT-x, Intel® EM64T (Intel® 64), and Execute Disable (XD) Bit functionality\n\n\n

I think prior programming experience will be essential for you to appreciate the course. Java knowledge will definitely help but not compulsory. I think the first week's materials will be released at 0:00am Hong Kong time (correct me if I am wrong) on 28th July. The online lectures are in the form of EDX videos and you can watch them at any time that fits you (will be released week by week and you can access them for the whole duration of the course).

Hi,\n\nYeah. I already removed these files long ago since I am using SSD and I don't need hibernation too here.\n\nActually that temporary emulator file can be set to other location too. One method is to change %USERPROFILE% variable which default refer to C:\Users\username\. The other method is to set symbolic link to other location, for example:\n\n> mklink /J "C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp\AndroidEmulator"\n> "D:\Android\temp"\n\nOn Linux you can specify ANDROID_TMP system variable, I haven't tried it yet on Windows.\n\nNOTE: Additional info for those who have problem with space too. You can move the whole SDK to other location (eg: other drive) if needed. Just set the location setting on the welcome page of Android Studio and then move the actual SDK files. I simply set it to D:\Android\sdk\n\n![SDK Location][1]\n\n\n  [1]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14378552085950436.png

It is not really useful for workstations or servers due to the amount of RAM they have got, but could be a problem with laptops\n\n\n...\n\nin my case I saved 6 gb,  disabling that file, I had to install the main android aplication  (and sdk) in one partition due to the lack of space, but I can not manage to configure the temporal files for virtualization, they reamain at C:Users>..> .android,..AndroidStudio1.2,....etc\n\n\nabout  "*pagefile.sys*", I left it with 3gb max,... but can be reset manually and restart the OS to leave that file into a moderate size ...\n
55b3a578b30d844457002031
Thanks for sharing :)\n\nDrive space is a problem for me too. I am using an old 64 GB SSD for primary drive on my laptop and because of that I have disabled these 2 files too. And for Android SDK, I put them on mechanical 750 GB secondary HDD.

If you hardware is intel you can use HAXM to speed your emulator, if your HW is AMD use emulator with API level 19 and check the "snapshot" option for more faster start or check "use GPU" for faster execution, unfortunately you can't check both options
55b29592a9a36ea584001f35
Hi,\n\n\nFor best performance on Intel processor with virtualization and HAXM enabled. Try this:\n\nSet AVD to use Galaxy Nexus API 21 or API 18. If you are using higher resolution virtual device, it will be much slower. Use Google API x86 image or x64 image if your host OS using 64bit. Set RAM to 768 MB. Lower than that, it might be slow. Depending on memory amount on host PC, higher than 1 GB RAM on emulator might be slow too.\n\nIf you can't get HAXM (example if using AMD PC), you might want to try to use Genymotion emulator instead. Some says it is faster even on Intel processor. But I haven't tried that myself because I heard it can't use telnet command.\n\nIf all of these still unbearably slow, you might want to consider using a cheap real Android device. Even an old device will be faster than emulator. But if using very old device, you might not be able to test some newer API features.\n\n\nThank you.\n

Sometimes it will be useful if we want to create dynamic UI using Fragment that shows different layout if installed on tablets.
55b29592a9a36ea584001f35
It's normal that AVD open very slow.  I suggest you open it at the very beginning and keep it running until you no longer need it.
55b089e4b30d846a86001e34
Both options are valid for personal purposes, not for this course, depending on what you want to do. Obviously the javascript code will not be as secure as a native application, HTML5/CSS3/javaScript require a web server, instead native application can run standalone, as I said before, everything depends on what you want to do.
55b23fd6a9a36e4e4e001ee3
If you are talking about AVD, then my suggestion is to use smallest size Phone AVD. It works better than others. You need more memory using Tablet and most of the time your testing will not work.

If you are only developing Android applications then I would have thought the sensible option would be to migrate your existing Eclipse projects to Android Studio (rather than vice versa) as the Android Studio IDE has been built specifically to aid development of Android applications. Also, I would expect there to exist an easy migration path from Eclipse to Android Studio, although I haven't tried this as yet!\n\nHave a look at the following link for some thoughts on Eclipse v Android Studio.\n\nhttps://www.infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/articles/eclipse-is-dead-for-android-development-and-i-helped-kill-it\n\nI hope this helps.

Could you open task manager and check the amount of free physical memory when Android studio hangs? If the free memory is too little, Android Studio could end up stalling waiting for the memory to be allocated.

Sort of a footnote, but... I'm still not certain if I did it correctly. I had thought I was done, but now I seem to have triggered some other SDK installations of 16 more packages. I hope I haven't confused it about the Java SDK that was required. The course specified an older version of the Java SDK, but I went with the latest release. Assuming too much about version compatibility and Google's competence?\n

Android Studio should not crash other applications. The culprit could be the lack of usable memory to the Windows Live Mail. How much memory do you have on your machine? Just for your information, Android studio would need at least 2GB of RAM to run.

Please check the installation instructions that we give for Android Studio. We depend mainly on Android API 21 and API 18 for the exercises. API 22 is still experimental and not needed for this course.
55aed7d5a9a36e1d46001d15
If you are well-versed with programming concepts, then it's just a matter of knowing Java syntax. Remember that Java and Android are two different animals. You will see a lot of Android specific code a lot in this course, which is different from Java. Having said that as long as you follow along my explanation in the course you should be fine.
55af6ca7b30d843537001cf6
The first week is to get all the Android studio installation issues weeded out before we launch into the actual course. The course materials will be available starting from 28 July one week at a time, so that the course is well-paced for all the students.

Hi,\n\nI have taken all of these courses as well. I think this is an interesting subject. Using native Java vs HTML5 and JavaScript technology like Phonegap or Sencha touch have their own trade offs. In my opinion:\n\nIf you want to build cross platform app for Android, iOS, Windows, etc, 1 language can be used on every available platform. You don't need to learn Objective C, Java, or C# to do any development.\n\nMobile phones are not fast enough to smoothly run JavaScript capabilities. Native Java apps will always have a better performance resulting in a better user experience and general feeling.\n\nOverall, if you want to build the same iOS and Android app on your own, but didn't want to learn Objective C (Objective C is a world of it own. It has a rather uncommon syntax), then using HTML5 might be a solution for you. But be advised, fixing possible future bugs, especially on big project, might be a painful work. \n\nThank you.\n

Occasionally the dl-ssl.google.com could be down, may be you could try again at another time. Otherwise, I think Wellsen is correct, you may want to download from a friend's house (or any other place that can connect to  dl-ssl.google.com ).

You may expect that the verbal explanation of the slides is still in the videos. The slides give us the outline and key points.
55ae2227b30d84b8bb001c3a
We'll provide the PDF slides for the course. However, it's best to watch the video to get the most benefit.

depends upon which api level you want to use for  your applicaition, it may take as   \nmini size as 2.2 gb or it may take a massive size such as 24 gb stated above.\njust download the necessary  files for the required api level i.e.,21 or 22 .and also repository and support libraries too , thats very important.\n\njust hit the link https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html \n<(")\n\n

you could close the project. And then at the Android studio start window, move the cursor to point to the project so that the project is highlighted, press 'Delete' key. At that point the project is removed from Android Studio. To remove it from the file system, simply navigate to its directory and delete the directory.

Hi,\n\nIf you got no response from ping. That means the host is totally unreachable.

Do you manage to "ping dl-ssl.google.com" and see its IP address? If you can see its IP yet you can not get the ICMP packets back, chances are either the site is (temporary) down or your firewall setting is blocking the site from you. If you can't even see its IP, then I guess your DNS server is not working properly.

when developing an app, you dont need to actually have an andoid phone as the studio has an inbuilt virtual simulator for you test your app on several different android devices. the only cool thing is: if you have an android device, you can plug it into your machine and put the application directly onto your phone and test it out yourself - hands on.

Essential Packages to download:\n\nTools:\n\n - Android SDK Tools\n - Android SDK Platform-tools\n - Android SDK Build-tools (Latest Version)\n\nAndroid 5.1.1 (API 22):\n\n - SDK Platform\n - Google APIs\n - Google APIs Intel x86 Atom System Image (Note: Install other images later as needed) \n - Sources for Android SDK\n\nExtras: \n\n - Android Support Repository\n - Android Support Library\n - Google Play Services\n - Google Repository\n - Google USB Driver (Windows)\n - Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator (HAXM Installer) (Windows)\n\nN.B: If you are using OS X or Linux, make sure to download and install SDK tools first and add the above packages (It will save you time when installing android studio because android studio will add them during installation if they are missing). \n\nFinally, install android studio and make sure to point to the android-sdk-(linux/mac) by using the custom option during installation. A message will tell you that it is pointing to an existing SDK (Missing packages will be downloaded and installed in case you didn't add the above basic packages).\n\nAs for the APIs the latest version is sufficient because it is backward compatible. Also, images can be used to test your application on a variety of devices so you don't have to rush and install all of them.\n\nI hope this will help you. 
55ae4e50b30d8482e6001c2b
Your target SDK (compiling sdk) will be the last version of android but the min. SDK will be the most known version of android like 4.3 because there is almost no devices with less than this version, so you need to download this version to test your app with it.

Android has his own frameworks for developing APPs. Though you have knowledge on OOP, so it will not be difficult to learn Android, in the mean you can learn some basics of Java which is similar to C++ and will help you more learning Android and will be more interesting.....

As LamAlex said, all of our exercises/assignments target to Android studio. If you try to use the Eclipse, you may face a lot of strange problems that could be tricky to solve. Please try to use Android Studio.\n

55ae28e0b30d843e96001c40
I think you should switch to Android Studio. All the operations of the note sets assume Android Studio as your IDE. You will need to do assignments with the code provided by us (which are in fact Android Studio projects). Moreover you also need to run test code to show that your application runs properly, this also assumes  Android Studio as the IDE.

Dear mymbugua, please be aware of the string manipulation in Java is quite different from the string manipulation in C/C++.

Apparently Android studio will only download the HAXM driver, but NOT INSTALL it. To install (first make sure Virtualization Technology is enabled in your bios, the steps in this article worked for my machine http://www.sysprobs.com/disable-enable-virtualization-technology-bios).\nAfter that navigate to the directory (C:\users\<Your Username>\AppData\Local\Android\sdk\extras > intel > Hardware_Accelerated_Execution_Manager and double click to run the file "intelhaxm-android.exe". Follow the instructions to finish installation.\n\nRestart Android Studio and then start AVD again.

Thanks for sharing. It looks nice but the development process becomes another story.
55ae1213a9a36e362d001cf8
Part of Java syntax is similar to C/C++. Java supports single inheritance while C++ supports multiple inheritance.\n\nJava programming experience is required for Android programming.
55ae4e50b30d8482e6001c2b
I think you need to download at least \n\nAndroid SDK tool 24.3\nAndroid SDK platform-tools 22\nAndroid 5.1.1 (API 22)\nAndroid 5.0.1 (API 21)\nsome "Extras" ( including support repository, support library, google USB driver, google repository, Intel HAXM)

In my opinion you should try to use Android Studio. If there will be Android Studio project examples from this course, it won't be able to be converted straightforward to Eclipse. In comparison Eclipse based can be imported directly to Android Studio. Moreover I think Eclipse is no longer supported by Google.\n\nBut I still use Eclipse for creating server side web services and other Java projects.\n\nOff topic note: Microsoft just released Visual Studio 2015 yesterday which supports JSE8, but I haven't tried it. Downloading community edition now :D\n

Hi,\n\nYou still need Android Studio (the IDE). Genymotion is an emulator. It is an alternative for Android emulator, which emulates android device on PC for testing and debugging purpose. The other alternative is to use real Android device.\n\nAndroid Studio isn't that huge if you install needed components only. Other components could be installed later wherever you need those. Of course it will become huge if you install every SDK Level and system images, but most likely you will only need some small subset of them.\n

i would have a look at a few basic tutorials for java to understand the logic behind it because logic will get a bit challenging, google john percell for basic java tutorials, they are free online :) or you could youtube java tutorials!
55ae1213a9a36e362d001cf8
if you have a basic understanding of java, it would be useful! but since you have other programming experience, the logic would be relatively similar :)
55ae23c9a9a36e7e59001cbe
you should ideally use android studio, its a free download for mac and windows. you will need to have the java SE installed - the java JDK and JRE and also android SDK - make sure that they are the same version and update version e.g. java 7_u79 for both java JRE and JDk :)\nits a relatively easy installation process assuming you have the right versions!

Thank you for the suggestions!\n\nMy laptop runs Windows 7 on Intel Core-i5\nprocessor with 4GB of RAM. In such a platform\nAndroid Studio with virtual device runs very\nslow (and doing other activities while emulator\nand Studio is running slows down considerably).\n\nI marked HAXM so that I want to install it,\nbut when installation was finished, HAXM was not\nmarked as installed in the right column as for other\npackages was done. I tried again to install only\nit, it was written that installation is complete,\nbut 'installed' still did not appear in the right column.\n\nDoes it mean that virtualization is not supported\nby my hardware or it is OK to not display this information\nsometimes?\n\nThanks!
55ae1213a9a36e362d001cf8
Absolutely! However, Java syntax is very similar to C/C++\n

In general I installed:\n\n - Latest version available for Android Studio, SDK Tools, platform\n   tools, and build tools. Certain API platform that will be used as\n   "target" API on the projects, usually the latest one.\n - Intel x86    system image which will be used for the emulator. I am\n   not using ARM    image. It will be very slow anyway on Android\n   emulator. No need TV    and other system image. You can install them\n   if you ever create    projects for that device later.\n - Support    library, HAXM for Android    emulator on Intel processor,\n   and Google    Play services for projects    that will use them later.\n\nIf you are not using Intel processor for your PC, or if your Intel processor doesn't support virtualization, HAXM wouldn't work. In that case, you might want to use real Android device or Genymotion Emulator instead. There is a free version for that. Many people said that Genymotion emulator is faster than Android emulator, even on Intel processor.\n\nhttps://www.genymotion.com/\n\nA bit precaution, Android Studio + emulator is quite heavy on hardware requirements. It might be very slow on older PC. Running 1 emulator with 768MB RAM will use my PC memory around 4 GB on Windows 7. If you use older PC you might want to consider using real Android device for debugging purpose.\n\n\nThank you.\n

Thanks! OK, I will install all that recommended!
55adf5dba9a36e00ed001c94
These packages could be for your future use. Having a more comprehensive set of packages installed sometimes will avoid you many strange problems while writing applications of the course.

Hi,\n\nI've been running Android Studio and Gradle with JDK8 for a few months without problem now. I am using the same JDK for Eclipse and my Java projects. I think you won't found any noticeable difference for the purpose of this course. But it seems that we can't use JDK8 specific features like lambda expressions and method references.\n\nAndroid Studio have just been adding support for JDK7 recently. I think we will need to wait for some time until the time JDK8 will be supported. Too bad, because Java 7 already reached End of Life on last April. The download link for the latest version of JDK7 is here:\n\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html\n\nIf you want, you will still be able to install JDK7 and JDK8 both on the same PC and you can select JDK location for your project on Project Structure menu item:\n![JDK Location][2]\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n  [2]: https://edxuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/14374564457958995.png

Definitely use JDK 8, 7 is on its way out.
55adadbda9a36e00ed001c5e
I ended up just installing it too.  I just hope we don't run into some kind of compatibility issue with the exercises or lectures down the road.  
55adadbda9a36e00ed001c5e
There will be no problem as i also install JDK8 and it is working..
